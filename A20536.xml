            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing better knowne, then well conſidered of, that in the myſticall body of Chriſt Ieſus, euery member hath his ſeuerall office, whereon it muſt attend, the weakeſt as well as the ſtrongeſt: and in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of the great Ruler of heauen and earth, each ſeruant hath his ſeuerall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which hee muſt imploy; the meaneſt, as well as the worthieſt. To deny my ſelfe to bee a member of that body, a ſeruant of that family, I cannot without iniurie to God and myſelfe: To profeſſe to bee ſuch a one in word, and in deed to denie it, were no leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
<pb facs="tcp:14997:3"/>to my head, to my maſter; then diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to my ſelfe. What then is to bee done? I bethought my ſelfe (for the auoiding of theſe rockes) what ſeruice I might performe, and in thinking, this which J haue now done, was offered to my conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereby as an vnderling in Gods houſhold, for want of greater abilitie, I haue done my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to put foorth to the beſt aduantage others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which elſe (to the griefe of many) would haue beene hidden at leaſt, if not vtterly loſt. For the doing whereof, I had rather vndergoe the cenſures of ſuch as are curious and carnally diſpoſed, then depriue thoſe of a benefit, that are religious and ſpiritually minded.</p>
            <p>Let it not bee offenſiue vnto your Ladiſhips that I haue preſumed to offer theſe Sermons vnto publike view, ſheltered as it were, vnder your names: for I had ſundry motiues which eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enforced me thus to do.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of the matter therein contained, much of it being deliuered in your hearing, and all of it ſuting vnto your affections, whoſe religious care for the preparing both of your ſelues, and of thoſe that depend vpon you, for the worthy receiuing of the holie Sacrament, is well knowne vnto thoſe that are acquainted with your conuerſation in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14997:3"/>
            <p>Secondly, in regard of the Authors, whoſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I perſwade my ſelfe is ſuch towards you, in ſundry both Ciuill and Religious reſpects, that they would moſt willinglie conſecrate themſelues and their labours to your further building vp in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in regard of my ſelfe, who for many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauours receiued, doe acknowledge my ſelfe vnrequiteablie indepted, and indiſſolublie bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Ladiſhips. And hauing nothing of mine owne of any worth whereby to teſtifie my vnfained thankefulneſſe, I haue borrowed of others for this purpoſe, and withall annexed my hand-writing, that if my ingratitude ſhould heereafter appeare, I might by a publike cenſure bee condemned and made aſhamed for the ſame. Thus hoping for pardon of my boldneſſe, and for fauourable acceptance of my good meaning in this behalfe, I humbly take my leaue, recommending your Ladiſhips to the Lord and to the word of his grace, who is able to perfect that good worke which hee hath begunne in you both.</p>

<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> as Adam was before his fall, and as the Saints and Angels are now in heauen; yea as Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe is, I being a member of his myſticall bodie.</p>
               <p>And ſo for Sanctification, though I be tainted with much ignorance, with many errors, with bad affections and euill actions; yet the Lord according to his couenant, will reforme all, and giue me a minde to know him, and his will; and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to hold faſt what I know: hee will giue me a heart to loue him, to feare him, and to obey his commandements.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wee muſt determine and endeuour to lead a new life, bringing foorth the fruits of repentance, faith and loue more abundantly then in former times, as hauing renewed our couenant with the Lord for that purpoſe: and therefore when wee finde any ſinnefull motions ſtirring within vs, wee ſhould reaſon thus, did I not at the Sacrament vowe and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God to ſtriue againſt all manner of corruptions? and did I not receiue the ſeale of the couenant in aſſurance that I ſhould haue power and ſtrength againſt them? why then ſhould I yeelde vnto them? why ſhould I bee any longer in bondage vnto them? nay, I will not ſerue ſinne in the luſts thereof, but will reſiſt it, and by the power of Chriſt, I ſhall get victorie ouer it:

Indeed the worthieſt receiuers, in their owne imaginations, and through Satans falſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeme vnto themſelues to be worſe, (when in truth they are not ſo) becauſe they feele their corruptions ſtirring more violently, and temptations ruſhing vpon them more fiercely then euer before: but this is ſo farre from being an argument of vnworthy receiuing, that if they ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to reſiſt in this combate, there can be no more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teſtimony of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuing: for now that their ſin hath had a deadly blow, it beginneth (like a madde bull in the ſame caſe) to rage more furiouſly; and Satan being diſpoſſeſſed of his holds, plyeth his buſineſſe with new and fearefull aſſaults; and therefore ſuch haue no cauſe at all to be diſmated, but rather very great cauſe to bee comforted.</p>

            <p>Whereſoeuer ſinne hath intertainment in the heart, ſound happineſſe is as farre from that partie, as hee himſelfe is from vprightneſſe and goodnes: God neuer caſtes away his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon them that endeauour not to caſt all ſinne out of their ſoules.
<note place="margin">pſal. 32.</note> This point is made cleere vnto vs in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> where the Prophet deſcribing a righteous man, and ſhewing that he, &amp; he alone is a bleſſed man, ſets him out by this, that <hi>in his ſpirit there is no guile:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>verſe</hi> 2.</note> Thereby implying, that guilefulnes and bleſſednes neuer goe together. He that with a falſe heart fauours himſelfe in any ſinne, hath obtained pardon for no ſinne; neither is he purged from any ſinne, what ſhewes ſoeuer he may make to deceiue himſelfe and others. And therefore all his iniquities ſhall be charged vpon him, the leaſt of which is ſufficient to make him accurſed: and then how farre ſuch a one is from happines and true proſperitie, any one may iudge that hath the ſpirit of diſcerning: and this point <hi>Dauid</hi> in that <hi>Pſalme</hi> makes plaine by giuing an inſtance in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He was no hypocrite indeede, yet had hypocriſie at that time a great place in his heart, and thereupon hee begins to hide his ſinne, and to inuent ſhiftes and deuiſes to couer the ſame:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>verſe</hi> 3.</note> but what followed heereupon? <hi>When I held my tongue</hi> (ſaith hee) (to wit from confeſſing my ſinne, as afterwards by his contrarie practiſe it is apparant) <hi>my bones conſumed, &amp;c.</hi> There hee ſhewes in many words what perplexitie hee was in, when he was negligent in ſearching out his corruptions, and his heart had made a kinde of confederacie with ſin: that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he was not vtterlie excluded from right to Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and true felicitie, yet for that time, hee could haue no ſound feeling nor comfort of it, till hee betooke him to true and heartie confeſſion; but then all was helped and remedied, as in that <hi>Pſalme</hi> it followeth, <hi>Then I acknowledged my ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee,
<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>To this ſame purpoſe there is a heauie threatning denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt this diueliſh cunning and craft in couering of ſin,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14997:18"/>by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.15.</note> Woe vnto them that ſeeke deepe to hide their counſels from the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> they that haue ſuch skill and arte to hide their wickedneſſe in the darke, and to carry badde matters couertly and cloſely, what doe they get by it? they thinke thereby to haue the credit and reputation of wiſe men &amp; deepe polititians: but the curſe of God belongs vnto them, which there is denounced againſt them, that ſhal purſue them, and his hand ſhall finde them out, with all their wretched and ſinnefull plots and deuiſes, which they haue hatched in the ſecrets of their braines, and thought to keepe cloſe from God and men: and he ſhall bring to nothing both them, and their counſels; for all their deepe reaches God can ouerreach them, and his iudgements ſhall ouertake and ouerthrowe them.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this, is the place of <hi>Iob,</hi> where it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Iob 20.1.</note> 
               <hi>that when wickedneſſe is ſweet to a man, and he hides it vnder his tongue, and fauours it, &amp;c.</hi> then <hi>his meate ſhall bee turned into the gall of Aſpes, &amp;c.</hi> There that holy man of God ſheweth, that when any one is a fauourer, and a hider of ſinne, euery thing that ſhould be for his good ſhall turne to his hurt; his ordinarie foode, his wealth and ſubſtance: and in a word, whatſoeuer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might bee comfortable vnto him, all ſhall goe croſſe with him: nothing ſhall bee proſpered and bleſſed vnto him. Theſe places doe in part manifeſt vnto vs the danger of this cloaking of ſinne: what miſerie it brings; what happineſſe it depriues vs of: yet beſides thoſe, there are reaſons that may more cleerely euict and prooue that it muſt needes bee ſo: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, the cauſes of this hiding of ſin are naught:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> which are theſe following.
<note place="margin">The cauſes of hiding of ſin.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt, is the loue of iniquitie: for ſinne is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">Loue of it.</note> that it will neuer tarie but where it is loued and much made of: it is ſuch a gueſt as rough intertainment would driue away in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>And that ſuch doe loue it, it is very euident in that former place of <hi>Iob:</hi> where it ſaid, that firſt, <hi>wickeneſſe is ſweet,
<note place="margin">Iob. 20.12.</note> and then they hide it.</hi> Looke what appetite and eager deſire any one that hath a ſweet tooth can poſſibly haue after pleaſant meates and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14997:19"/>dainty diſhes: the ſame or greater haue they after ſinne: the loue whereof muſt needes be odious, becauſe it is Gods vtter enemie, and therefore the hiding of it muſt needes bee dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond cauſe of this, is hypocriſie, that men would faine ſeem better then they are,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and therefore they hide that which is in them indeed,
<note place="margin">Hypocriſie.</note> &amp; make ſhew of that innocencie which they are farre from: this was the cauſe that made <hi>Dauid</hi> to diſſemble and cloake his great offence in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> as the holy Ghoſt teſtifieth in the booke of the <hi>Kings:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 15.3.5</note> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Abijams heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as the heart of Dauid his Father, who did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and turned from nothing that hee commanded him all the daies of his life</hi> (to wit, of ſet purpoſe, and againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with any allowance and approbation) <hi>ſaue onely in the matter of Vriah the Hittite:</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, therein indeede hee was falſe-hearted, and that was the reaſon why he was ſo long ere hee acknowledged his grieuous ſinne, and why he fell to deuiſing of naughtie ſhifts for the couering of his wickedneſſe: which brought him little proſperitie: nay, ſo farre was hee from gaining any thing by it, that euen one yeeres cloaking of ſinne, procured him many ſoare and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous troubles inward and outward for many yeeres together. Thus we ſee the cauſes are bad, to wit, loue of ſinne, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Neither are the effects any better:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for whoſoeuer doth thus couer his ſinnes:
<note place="margin">The il effects.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">It hindereth praier.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly ſuch a one can haue no benefit by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 59.2.</note>
               <note place="margin">It keepes vs from benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the Sacrament. Iohn 13.27.</note> as we ſee by <hi>Iudas:</hi> who being a cunning hypocrite, and a hider of miſcheuous plots againſt his maſter, whereas hee was diueliſh enough before, he was wholly poſſeſt by Satan af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the eating of the Paſſeouer and the receiuing of the Lords Supper: for ſo the <hi>Euangeliſt</hi> teſtifieth that <hi>after the ſop,</hi> (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14997:19"/>after the others Sacrament, miniſtred at that ſame meale) <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan entered into him:</hi> meaning more fully then euer before: the like may bee ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus Act.</hi> 8.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly the word is altogether vnprofitable vnto ſuch:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <note place="margin">Or by the word.</note> it's choaked in the heart that is corrupted with ſinne: it is euen like pure ſeede caſt into a filthie ſincke. There we ſee both by the cauſes and effects, how hurtfull a thing this hiding of ſin is, and how it ſtands in the way of all true proſperitie, to keepe the ſame from comming vnto vs.</p>
            <p>But againſt this it may be obiected,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
               </label> that it ſeemes to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true that thoſe that entertaine and nouriſh ſinne in their ſoules ſhall not proſper: for none proſper more then ſuch; they commit hainous and ſcandalous euils, and boaſt of them, and yet haue the world at will, and more then their hearts can wiſh. And on the contrarie, <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſalm. 73.</note> 
               <hi>When I declare my paine, and am ſorie for my ſinne, then mine enemies are aliue, and are mightie, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the ſatisfying of this doubt, we wuſt know,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.18.</note> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer theſe vngodly ones hold vp their heads and proſper,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
               </label>
               <note place="margin">Proſpering in euill courſes, a ſore plague of God.</note> and bring many of their purpoſes to paſſe, yet none are more wretched and miſerable then they. There is no more certaine ſigne of Gods heauie diſpleaſure, then for one to thriue in his vngodly courſes. That child whom the father loues, hee will correct betime: and ſo dealt God with <hi>Dauid.</hi> There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater offenders then hee in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet none was ſo much ſcourged, becauſe none was ſo well beloued. But for one to eſcape the rodde, and to be ſtill further giuen vp to his owne hearts luſt, to commit ſinne with greedines, this is the moſt heauie ſtroake and fearefull iudgement that can poſſible fall vpon any man:
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> for by this meanes hee ſtill heapeth vp wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the declaration of the iuſt vengeance of God vpon all vnrighteous and vnholy perſons, when the Lord ſhall pay him home at full for all his cuill thoughts, words and workes.</p>
            <p>Since then it is plaine,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that hiding of our tranſgreſſions ſtops vp the paſſage againſt all true proſperity,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <note place="margin">Sorts repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> this makes for the reproofe of foure ſorts of men, that offend in this point: namely,</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:14997:20"/>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of thoſe that are altogether blinded with ignorance, and know not ſinne,
<note place="margin">Ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> nor the diſſerences of ſinne, which are greater, which leſſer. For till the Lord informe men by his word, and ſpirit, they can neuer ſee theſe things; neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwixt good and euil, nor betwixt euil and euill which is more or leſſe offenſiue. For it is light that diſcouers darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore they being deſtitute of the true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the word, and ſo conſequently of the ſpirit, muſt needs faile in the diſcerning, and ſo alſo in the diſcouering and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open of their corruptions; and therefore faile of ſound happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this is for the reproofe of an other ſort that are worſe then the former,
<note place="margin">Deniers of ſinne.</note> who hauing the knowledge of ſin, doe yet denie their faults when they are told of them, as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> &amp; <hi>Saphira</hi> did,
<note place="margin">Acts 5. 1. King. 5.</note> and as <hi>Iehazi</hi> did when his maſter examined him. Thoſe ſinnes that are ſmoothered and caried ſo cloſely, God will manifeſt and diſcouer as openly, as hee did theirs: laying vpon the one, the puniſhment of a ſudden and ſtrange death: and on the other, the leproſie of his fleſh, as a meanes to clenſe his ſoule.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Heere are an other kinde of hiders to be condemned,
<note place="margin">Diſguilers of ſinne.</note> that will not groſly denie the fact, but will cloake it, and diſguiſe it, and giue good names to foule faults.</p>
            <p>Such are they that would haue their gaming, and vnthrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and coſonage, to goe vnder the name of recreation; and all their leaud meetings, and abuſe of the creatures of God, and of the glorious and fearefull name of God, vnder the title of good fellowſhip, and meerie meetings, &amp;c. And ſo for other notorious and greeuous ſinnes, which they paint ouer with faire colours: but doe ſuch proſper? When they get a little monie,
<note place="margin">Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that enſue on gaming.</note> do they not looſe more in their ſoules then that comes to? and doe they not bring vpon themſelues hardneſſe, and profanenes of heart: blindneſſe, and ſtupiditie of minde: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readineſſe and vnfitnes for any good thing: vnwillingnes to reade, heare, meditate, and conferre of holy things? are they not afraid to come into Gods holie preſence in praier, to be in the company of ſuch as will admoniſh or rebuke them; to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14997:20"/>bee alone in the night at ſuch times as the Lord doth waken their drouſie conſciences? to ſay nothing of many foule braules, and other hainous euils, which doe vſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie ſuch exerciſes.</p>
            <p>So others when they are paſſionate and diſtempered; tell them of it, &amp; their anſwer is readie: What? would you not haue a man angrie with ſin? Oh this is baſe hypocriſie, and ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſguiſing of your fault: for tell mee, you that can bee ſo eager againſt ſmall offences in others, when they concerne your ſelfe,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
               </label> do you not beare with greater faults both in others and in your ſelfe, when they doe more neerely touch the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God? your owne heart tel you that it is ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer ſuffer your violent diſtempers and outrages to goe vnder the viſard of zeale againſt ſinne, but let them goe for hatefull paſſions as they are.</p>
            <p>Others wee ſhall finde that will terme their couetouſnes, frugalitte, their pride in apparell, comlines and decencie,
<note place="margin">Hurt that comes by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing of ſin.</note> and the like: all which perſons little conſider what great iniurie they doe to their ſoules this while: for now the word cannot cure them of thoſe ſinnes which they would faine thinke (though their hearts tell them otherwiſe) to bee no ſinnes: they can neuer humble themſelues by repentance for them; and therefore they ſtand guiltie before Gods iudgement ſeate to anſwer for them, beſides all the hurt they ſhall in this life ſuſtaine in regard of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A fourth ſort that come vnder this reproofe are ſuch,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as therein ſhew themſelues to be clokers of ſinne,
<note place="margin">Such as are negligent in ſearching out their ſinnes.</note> that they doe not vſe diligence to finde out their ſinnes: ſuch as are partiall in dealing with their own ſoules, and in ſearching to finde out their corruptions; that are loth to dig too deepe, &amp; throughly to ranſack the lothſome corners of their hearts. He that doth not his beſt endeuour to come to the ſight of his ſecret ſinnes, is eſteemed by God, to be a hider of them, and ſhall be deſtitute of that happineſſe and comfort that otherwiſe hee might enioy:
<note place="margin">Pſalm. 4.4.</note> and therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi> exhorted his enemies for their good, to <hi>examine their hearts vpon their beds,</hi> that ſo they might deſiſt from ſtanding out againſt him: ſo hee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed it himſelfe for the good of his owne ſoule, that

One comes to the word preached, and findes no helpe thereby againſt the corruptions vnto which he is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor for the practiſe of good duties vnto which hee is ſlacke: he cannot perceiue that there is wrought in him any great loue vnto the Saints, to the ordinances of God, or to the comming of Chriſt, &amp;c. but he is dull and heauie, when hee is at it, and as dead and lumpiſh when he is gone from it. Let him ſearch, and he ſhall finde that there lies in his heart ſome ſin or other vnrepented, or the gilt of ſome duties vnperfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; the venome whereof doth ſo poiſon his conſcience, that the word of life can finde no place there; for when the word comes to a pure heart, it will enter ſpeedily, and worke effectually.</p>
            <p>Another comes to the Sacrament, and findes no benefite thereby. Let him looke if there lurke not within him ſome hidden corruption that is the cauſe hereof: for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is mightie in operation, if it be receiued with a pure and holy affection:
<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Likewiſe for the things of the world: doe we not proſper in our eſtate, in our bodies, in our children? &amp;c. let vs make triall if there be not ſome wickedneſſe that hath countenance with vs.

Sith then, that without this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion there is no promiſe made vnto vs, no ſound repentance in vs, no abilitie to reſiſt corruption for the time to come: and whereſoeuer this is (on the contrarie ſide) it puts life into our praiers, and brings honour vnto Gods name; the point is cleere and euident, that this confeſſion is ſo neceſſarie, that without it there is no mercie to be looked for from God.</p>
            <p>Which maketh for the iuſt reproofe and condemnation of thoſe that faile in this dutie.

For grant that the occaſion of their fall was more from them, yet the cauſe was in themſelues, euen their own curſed corruption, and rebellious diſpoſition. And therefore their labouring to put off the blame and ſhame of their ſinnes vpon others, euidently proclaimeth, that they haue not an vnderſtanding minde, nor a broken, and humble, and penitent heart. And the like may bee ſaid of thoſe: that howſoeuer they will come to a recitall of diuers miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, either before God or men, or both: as the qualitie of their offences requireth the ſame, yet they doe it ſo ſlightly and coldly, that though they name particulars, it is ſure they are not touched with them: ſuch a cold confeſſion will bring as cold conſolation; their faint and careleſſe ſueing for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is the next way to procure them a deniall.</p>

            <p>And the firſt thing in that is, that wee confeſſe hartily and ſincerely,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with ſorrow and ſhame that we haue prouoked ſo gracious a God.
<note place="margin">It muſt bee hartie. Luke 18, 13. Iere 31.18</note> So did the <hi>Publican</hi> when hee ſmote vpon his breaſt, and ſaid, <hi>Lord be mercifull vnto mee a ſinner.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Ephraim:</hi> of whom the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh in this manner. <hi>I heard Ephraim lamenting thus: Thou haſt corrected mee, and I was chaſtiſed, as an vntamed calfe, &amp;c. Surely after
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14997:25"/>that I conuerted, I repented: and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote vpon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea euen confounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did beare the reproach of my youth.</hi> Where it is declared, that after they had beene long and greeuouſly afflicted, and began at length to be ſoundly humbled, they did not onely ſee and acknowledge their ſins, but were vexed and troubled, and euen confounded at the conſideration, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of them, yea euen of the follies and vanities of their youth. Contrarie to this practiſe of theirs, is the cuſtome of many, who will reckon vp and recount their ſeuerall iniquities before the Lord, but they doe it ſo idly and drowſily, as if it were nothing to offend him. Whereas if a child ſhould come with ſuch a rude and bold confeſſion of his faults to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: or a wife ſpeake ſo ſleightly of her vnchaſt and vnholy behauiour before her husband, they would diſlike the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the faults, more then the faults themſelues; and all that heard them would cry out vpon them,
<note place="margin">Drouſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> there is an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wife, and a graceleſſe child. And wee muſt not conceiue then, that God will be pleaſed with ſuch lame and maimed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Let none bee deceiued, God will not bee mocked: hee pronounceth him accurſed, whoſoeuer he bee, that doth the worke of the Lord negligently.</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing to be obſerued in the manner of it is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that we confeſſe not our ſins in the lumpe only,
<note place="margin">It muſt bee particular, and of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes.</note> and by whole ſale as it were, but that we bring before his holy eies our particular, and ſpeciall ſinnes, which will bee vnto vs a teſtimony of great vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, for we are naturally prone, either to content our ſelues with a generality of confeſſion, that wee are great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Lord be mercifull vnto vs, &amp;c. which wee may doe for our credit that wee would be eſteemed penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<note place="margin">Note this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> or if wee come to particulars, wee will rather meddle with any, then with our beloued ſinnes: as in the body, wee would bee dealing with any, rather then with our particular ſoare, that will moſt paine vs, if we ſhould ſet vpon the curing of it: our chiefe ſins are ſo deepely rooted, that we cannot get them vp, but we muſt breake a great deale of ground round about. This therefore argueth great ſinceritie, when we can bring our capitall and head ſinnes to arraignement: as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14997:25"/>Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did, when once he was throughly conuerted:
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13. Ezra. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>a blaſphemer, and a perſecuter, and an oppreſſor.</hi> And likewiſe good <hi>Ezra,</hi> who acknowledged in the behalfe of the people their manie great ſinne of marrying ſtrange wiues. whoſe practiſe if we can follow, we ſhall haue that good eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſoundneſſe and vprightneſſe in our ſoules that they had.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> this makes for the ſingular comfort of Gods children, that can particularly aggrauate their ſecret ſinnes, that no body in the world can touch them for: their beloued ſinnes, which heretofore they would not for a kingdome haue parted from. That no malitious reuengfull wicked man can ſo ſet out the faults of his enemie, whom he hates with a deadly hatred, as they can the corruptions of their owne hearts and liues. This is a ſigne that their conſciences are touched by the holy ſpirit of grace, whoſe ſpeciall and proper worke it is,

            <p>And that a ſound confeſſion, and a holy reformation goe together, might bee further prooued, by the examples of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of <hi>Paul,</hi> which were formerly alleged: who hauing once made acknowledgement of their ſinnes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fell to the committing of them any more.

               </label> they mend no daie; then let them looke for no mercy. But to come more neerely to ſuch kind of men: they affirme they haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their ſwearing, and blaſpheming: their drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſwilling: their brawling, &amp; contending: their rayling, &amp; reuiling of ſuch as are better then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed theſe, &amp; the like to be great faults, and haue been ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their hearts for them: but haue they left theſe foule ſins? Oh no, fleſh &amp; blood is weake; and all haue their infirmities, &amp; ſo haue they infirmities. Nay, theſe are groſſe preſumptuous euils, and ſuch as howſoeuer being weighed in the ballance of the fleſh, they ſeeme light; yet being weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuarie, they will be found ſufficient to preſſe them downe vnto the pit of hell, if they ceaſe not from the practiſe of them. And as for fleſh and blood, which they ſay is weake, What ſhould Chriſtians talke of that? (in the ſenſe that they doe) if they be but fleſh and blood, they can neuer enter into the kindome of heauen. They that are Chriſts,
<note place="margin">Iohn 3.3.</note> haue crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fleſh, with the luſts and affections thereof: neither <hi>are wee any longer debiters to the fleſh to liue according thereunto:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> but me muſt mortifie the deedes of the fleſh by the ſpirit:</hi> that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſinne will ſtill remaine in vs, yet it may not <hi>raigne in our mortall bodies,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>obey it in the luſts thereof,</hi> or that our <hi>members ſhould be weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe</hi> for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euill any more. And this wee may boldly ſay,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> that whoſoeuer liueth in thoſe forenamed ſinnes, neuer yet knew what repentance for ſinne, and ſound confeſſion of ſinne meanes. And therefore what good conceite ſoeuer ſuch haue of themſelues, they doe but flatter and diſſemble with a double heart. If they haue had ſome gripings for their ſcandalous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14997:27"/>and ſinnefull manner of liuing, and thereupon haue caſt forth ſome peece of a confeſſion, the beſt that they can make of it, is but this,
<note place="margin">Dogſicke.</note> that they haue been dogge-ſicke (as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and ſo diſgorged their ſtomackes of that that pained them: not in any hatred of the things (for they returne to their vomite againe) but in deſire to be exempted and freed from thoſe bitter pangs, and helliſh tortures which they finde in their ſoules. At moſt, they are but as the ſow that hath been waſhed, ſeeing that they returne to their old filthines. There hath beene onely a change of the outſide, none at all of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: for if their nature had beene altered and renewed, their words and workes would haue beene reformed, and that not for a fit, but for euer in the whole courſe of their cariage after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. They might indeed now and then meete with a rubbe, and ſtumble ſometimes, but their walke for the moſt parte, ſhould be in the waies of godlineſſe; and though they did fall, they ſhould riſe againe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> becauſe the Lord <hi>would put vnder his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore let all men carefully looke vnto themſelues: if they were ſwearers before the Sacrament,
<label type="milestone">

               </label> and be ſwearers ſtill: if idle perſons, vnthrifts, ſcoffers, &amp;c. before they come to the word, and continue to be ſuch ſtill, their caſe is fearefull. Let them be afraid how they ſtand in the courts of Gods houſe to heare; and how they draw neere to the Lords table to receiue the holy things of God. For if they come not to be helped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe grieuous ſinnes which heretofore they haue liued in, let them know, they ſhall find no mercy: and if they finde not mercy,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
               </label> they ſhall be ſure to meete with iudgement: they ſhall not miſſe of one. And howſoeuer they may bragge that they truſt to be ſaued as well as the beſt, when their liues are as bad as the worſt, yet they ſhall finde at the time of death, and when the horrible terrors of their guiltie conſciences ſhall ſurpriſe them, that all ſuch boaſting hath beene vaine: and that true repentance conſiſtes in a change of the life without, as well as of the heart within: and then if they haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken their ſinnes, they ſhall be in danger, and in feare to goe from the pangs of death to the paines of hell.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former part of this Chapter, the Prophet had charged theſe Iewes, that though they caried the name of Gods children, and of Gods people, &amp; thought themſelues in very good caſe, yet they were indeed notable traitors and rebels againſt him; which rebellion of theirs is ſet out by two compariſons: for firſt he compares them with the Oxe and the Aſſe, which though they bee of the dulleſt ſort of creatures, yet the <hi>one knowes and remembers his owner:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

But theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> though they had been fed at full, and receiued innumerable bleſſings from the Lord, yet they were vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of God, and of his fauours, and more vnteachable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their dutie, then were the Oxe or the Aſſe.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14997:30"/>They conſidered not whence, nor why, they had thoſe many mercies which they enioyed, and therefore did ſeruice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, not to God, but to their owne luſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, hauing compared them to the dulleſt beaſts, and prooued them to bee inferiour vnto thoſe vnreaſonable creatures; Hee after makes compariſon betwixt them and the vileſt ſinners in the world, to wit, the <hi>Sodomites:</hi> to whom they were ſo like for their idleneſſe, pride, exceſſe, and crueltie, that he cals them by that name. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. ſaying, <hi>Heare the word of the Lord, O yee Princes of Sodome: hearken vnto the Law of our God, O people of Gomorah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt this, they might except, and ſay to the Prophet, you doe vs wrong, in thus charging, and vilifying vs: we are other manner of people then you take vs for, and would make vs ſeeme to be: wee haue ſome things to commend vs, which neither beaſts nor <hi>Sodomites</hi> haue: for we offer multitudes of ſacrifices, and obſerue ſolemne daies, and feaſts, the new moones, and Sabbaths, and the like.</p>
            <p>This hee yeelds they did; but thence taketh aduantage, and doubleth his accuſation againſt them, turning all theſe things to their deeper condemnation. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11.12.13.14. <hi>What haue I to doe with the multitude of your ſacrifices, ſaith the Lord?

My ſoule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth your new moones, &amp;c.</hi> and there is reaſon why God ſhould thus abhorre both them, and the worſhip they offered vnto him. For, (as it is added) <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. when they ſtretched out their hands in praier, <hi>their hands were full of blood.</hi> That is, they were full of reuenge, full of crueltie, and contention, and therefore they muſt needs performe thoſe religious exerciſes hypocritically and carnally: in which reſpect they were worſe then <hi>Sodomites:</hi> for they did but abuſe their time to idlenes, their apparell to pride: their diet to exceſſe, &amp;c. but the <hi>Iewes</hi> abuſed the word, and the ſacrifices, and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and other ordinances of God: and therefore as much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14997:30"/>as ſpirituall things are better then naturall, ſo much worſe were they that prophaned the former, then the <hi>Sodomites</hi> that abuſed the latter.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing ſhewed them how bad they were,
<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> hee leaueth them not heere, but telleth them how all might bee amended. <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. <hi>Waſh you, make you cleane, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, I haue ſhewed that you haue polluted and defiled your ſelues beyond the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and ſo are become exceeding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and vnholy: yet if you will take my aduiſe, and follow my counſell, I will ſhew you a way how you ſhall helpe all, and that is, to waſh and clenſe your ſelues from this your fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, by godly and heartie ſorrow for the ſame: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you will be readie to conceiue that this is a matter eaſily and quickly done, I tell you that it is otherwiſe, and therefore bid you <hi>waſh you, make you cleane:</hi> purge your hearts and your hands: waſh and waſh; againe and againe: and neuer leaue waſhing till you haue made your ſelues thorowly cleane.</p>
            <p>Then further, that they might not deceiue themſelues, hee declareth vnto them more particularly what ſinnes they ſhould waſh away: <hi>take away the euill of your workes, &amp;c.</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in including an anſwer to another obiection, that the hearts of ſome might make, concerning their ſacrifices, and their praiers, &amp;c. before mentioned: for they might reply vpon the Prophet in this manner: you finde fault with our obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tell vs that God loathes our ſacrifices, and ſeruices; what then would you haue vs doe? ſhould we leaue off theſe workes of piety, and quite giue ouer ſeruing of God?</p>
            <p>Not ſo (ſaies the Prophet:) but <hi>take away the euill of your workes.</hi> doe the works ſtill, but remoue that which God hates in them: re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine the matter, but reforme the manner of them. Now whereas ſome might be ſo ſhameleſſe, as to ſay, we haue done ſo already, and doe ſo ſtill: who can charge vs with the euill of our works, or with hollownes, and hypocriſie in the performance of them?</p>
            <p>To that he makes anſwer in theſe words, <hi>take away the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of your workes, [from before mine eies.]</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, if you might be iudged by men, like your ſelues, you would make a good ſhift: but in religious exerciſes you appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14997:31"/>the Lord, who hath firie eies, and eſpieth the leaſt ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in your ſeruices: and therefore looke that he ſee nothing in them diſpleaſing vnto him: for otherwiſe, howſoeuer men commend you, and your workes, God will reiect both them, and you. After this he proceedeth, and ſheweth, that if they muſt take away the euill of their beſt workes, much more muſt they deſiſt from their euil workes: and therefore hee addeth, <hi>ceaſe to doe euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this is not inough, but he exhorts them further to <hi>do wel:</hi> and becauſe they were ill ſcholers, and altogether vnskilful in heauenlie matters, he bids them <hi>[learne to doe well:]</hi> as who ſhould ſay:
<note place="margin">verſ. 17.</note> you are naturally wittie to inuent miſchiefe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie: but for good, you haue no wiſdome, nor ſound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: you know not what to doe, nor how to doe: you haue neither a good iudgement, nor a pure affection; nor know how to get either of them, and therefore <hi>learne to doe well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then for their better direction, he commeth to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>ſeeke iudgement, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee ſhould haue tolde them in more words: you haue beene giuen to oppreſſion heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and haue done much wrong to poore men, that could not make good their parte againſt you: this hath been your ſinne, to deale craftily and vnrighteouſly: but now take a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe; <hi>ſeeke iudgment,</hi> that is, labour to finde out what is right; and when you know it, practiſe it accordingly; and deale with others, as you would be dealt withall: giue ouer your crueltie; and exerciſe mercy: and bee ſo farre from oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any more, that now ye <hi>releeue the oppreſſed:</hi> and ſo farre from doing hurt hereafter, that you foorthwith ſtriue to doe good: eſpecially to the poore, and ſuch as ſtand in moſt need of your helpe and relife: not ſuch poore, as by their owne lewdneſſe and miſdemenour haue caſt them ſelues, and doe ſtill plunge themſelues further in miſerie: but <hi>iudge the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and defend the Widdowe:</hi> and ſtretch foorth your hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand to releeue ſuch as are moſt worthy of it, and haue moſt neede of it.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus vrged them to ſound repentance, that they might haue no pretence to keepe them from ſetting vpon it;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14997:31"/>he remoueth certaine doubts that might ariſe in their harts to hinder them. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 18. And before hee commeth to them, he maketh proparation thereunto, ſaying, <hi>come, let vs reaſon together.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, now I haue plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it ſtands you vpon to repent, and haue ſhewed you how you ſhould repent, I know you ſhall haue diuers reaſons from your ſelues, and from the world to the contrarie: but hearken not what your fleſh, or your friends ſay, but what God ſaith, <hi>come let vs reaſon together.</hi>

            <p>Now,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection, </seg>1</label> the firſt obiection to keepe them from turning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God (as may appeare by the anſwer heere ſet downe) is this: You haue charged vs to be worſe then beaſts, or <hi>Sodomites,</hi> to be full of crueltie and blood, and our conſciences tell vs no leſſe: ſeeing then we are ſunke ſo deepe in our iniquities, it ſeemes our ſtate is vnrecouerable, and ſo it is booteleſſe for vs to ſet vpon the worke of repentance.</p>

<label type="milestone">

               </label> for though you be ſo ſtained with ſinne and impiety, as I haue ſaid: that not onely your hands, but your ſoules and bodies, and all bee wholly imbrued with bloody and cruell dealing, and your ſinnes be as red as skarlet or crimſon, which are double dyed, and died in the woll, ſo that you thinke it impoſſible to be brought to any whitneſſe and pureneſſe againe, (as indeede in regard of men it is impoſſible) yet God is able to make you <hi>as white as ſnow.</hi> Albeit you haue receiued a double die of ſinne, one in your conception, and another in the whole courſe of your conuerſation all your life long: Yet the Lord is of that power, that hee is able to make you <hi>white as well.</hi> There is no ſinne ſo hainous; no ſinner ſo abominable, but vpon his humiliation and conuerſion, hee can and will make him as cleane, and as pure; as iuſt and as righteous as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall, and as if hee had neuer tranſgreſſed at all. Not that hee ſhall be without infirmities: but in Gods account, and acceptance through Chriſt, hee ſhall be as holy as the Angels are now in heauen, or as hee himſelfe ſhall be, when he is an heire of glory in that bleſſed kingdome.

And that God will take in good worth this kind of obedience, he will teſtifie and make cleere, not onely by beſtowing inward bleſſings vpon the ſoule, but alſo outward bleſſings for their eſtate: <hi>you ſhall eate the good things of the land.</hi>

            <p>Heere then, the purpoſe and drift of the Prophet is thus much, namely that we ſhould ioyne with God, as working in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in reforming our hearts, and redreſſing our waies. Whence ariſeth this point of doctrine;

            <p>Before the Lord promiſeth any cleanſing on his parte, hee requireth this kind of purging on our part.
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.8.9.</note> This is cleare in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Iames,</hi> where he vrgeth them to <hi>draw neere vnto the Lord,</hi> (to wit, in the miniſterie of the word, in partaking of the holy Sacrament, in faithfull and feruent praier, and the reſt of God ordinances) and then he telleth them, that <hi>God will drawe neere vnto them,</hi> namely, in his mercie and goodnes, and in all the fruits and effects thereof. But then they muſt waſh themſelues: for hee is a God of pure eies, and cannot indure iniquitie, and therefore hee ſaith, <hi>Clenſe your hands yee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and purge your hearts yee hypocrites.</hi> But they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and ſay, Is it ſo eaſlie a matter to cleanſe our hearts, and our hands?

            <p>It doth ſo indeed; and yet if they would follow his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſheweth them a way how they might quickely be ridde of their corruptions, ſo that they ſhould not raigne ouer them though they did remaine in them: and that is, <hi>afflict your ſelues, and ſorrow, and weepe: let your laughter, and ieſting, and fooliſh ſporting, bee turned into nourning; and your ioy into heauineſſe, and lamentation for your iniquities and prouocations, whereby you haue incenſed the Lord:</hi> and then though they were brought neuer ſo low, yet if they begin to caſt downe themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14997:33"/>the Lord, he will aſſuredly raiſe them vp, as there it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>This dutie is further commanded in the Prophecie of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> where hee ſpeaketh to the whole Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 4.14.</note> in this manner: <hi>O leruſalem, waſh thy heart from thy wickedneſſe, that thou maieſt bee ſaued: how long ſhall thy wicked thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine within thee?</hi> In which place is declared what they muſt waſh; their hearts: For they being made cleane, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer proceedeth from thence muſt needs beſutable theunto. Secondly, from what they muſt waſh them; from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe: and laſtly, to what end; that they might be ſaued. As if the Prophet had told them in plainer termes; God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to giue you ſaluation, and deliuerance, both from your ſinnes, and from your miſeries: but your owne backwardnes hindreth good things from you: you doe not your dutie, and therefore God withholds his mercie, and therefore <hi>waſh thine heart, O Ieruſalem, that thou maiſt be ſaued.</hi> And that they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this waſhing, hee proueth by this euill fruit that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſpring out of their ſinnefull hearts, ſaying, <hi>How long ſhall thy wicked thoughts remaine within thee?</hi> As if he had ſaid: If you doubt of the badneſſe of your hearts, looke what thoughts you entertaine therein; in the night, and in the day: when you are at home, and when you are abroad: on the way as you ride, or walke: on your beds as you ſleepe, or wake &amp;c. Conſider how many vaine and idle thoughts: how many worldlie and couetous deſires: how many luſtfull and carnall, yea wicked and impious imaginations, you haue ſwarming, and as it were muſtering together by whole troopes and armies within your minds, and within your hearts: euery one of which is a ſufficient ſummons to put you in minde, to cleanſe your ſoules: for if they were pure and vndefiled, ſuch cogitations and affections woul dnot bee ſtirring there, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo often, nor ſo much as now they are.
<note place="margin">Ioel 2.13.</note>

            <p>The Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> in like ſort vrgeth the ſame vpon thoſe of his time, ſaying, <hi>Rent your harts, and not your cloaths, &amp;c.</hi> But how muſt that be done?

<note place="margin">The effect of godly ſorrow.</note> and make it gentle and pliable.

               <hi>Chap.</hi> and the good iſſue and effect thereof declared in the 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> As touching the firſt, we may read it in the 10.11.12.13.14. <hi>verſes</hi> of the former Chapter. <hi>I will poure vpon the houſe of Dauid</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and vpon the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, the ſpirit of grace &amp;c. and they ſhall lament, &amp;c.</hi> where we may note firſt, the grieuouſneſſe of their mourning, (when once Gods holy ſpirit hath entered into their hearts) in that they ſhould make ſuch wofull lamentation, as one would doe <hi>for his onely ſonne, and for his firſt borne:</hi> or as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did for <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> their godly, and zealous, and faithfull King, and gouernour,

And ſecondly, wee may note the ſinceritie thereof, in that they ſhould not weepe for company (as an hypocrite may doe) but euery one aparte, and in ſecret before the Lord.

               <note place="margin">Zache. 13.1.</note> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. the words are theſe: <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountaine opened to the houſe of Dauid, and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, for ſinne, and for vncleanneſſe.</hi> Whence it may bee gathered, that when once we fall a waſhing in this ſort, we ſhall not long waſh alone, but God will ioyne with vs, and open a fountaine of mercie vnto vs, to waſh away all manner of ſinnes, whatſoeuer they are, or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14997:34"/>haue beene; and to giue vs grace in ſteed thereof: And this promiſe is made, not onely to the <hi>houſe of Dauid:</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">See Chap. 12.8. for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> to ſtrong Chriſtians: but alſo to the <hi>inhabitants of Ieruſalem,</hi> that is, to weaker Chriſtians.

            <p>This point may bee further confirmed vnto vs by plaine reaſons drawne from the Scriptures of God: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, there can bee no ſound repentance,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> without this religious and holy mourning:
<note place="margin">No ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without mourning for ſinne.</note> therefore when <hi>Ephraim</hi> fell to repentance, God himſelfe witneſſeth that hee <hi>heard him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting</hi> and bewailing his former ſinnefulneſſe, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of his youth.

For, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a contrite ſpirit:

            <p n="2">2 A ſecond reaſon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to ſhew the neceſſitie of this inward touch for ſinne, is,
<note place="margin">No faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</note> that without the ſame it is impoſſible wee ſhoud haue any faith: for the promiſe is made to them that are wearie of their corruptions; as a poore priſoner is of his bolts and Irons:
<note place="margin">Luke 4.18</note> euen to them that account ſinne to bee a bondage and a captiuitie vnto them.
<note place="margin">Math. 11.28.</note> And none haue any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to come vnto Chriſt, but thoſe that are <hi>wearie and heauie laden:</hi> if they feele not their ſickneſſe, the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is not a Phiſitian for their turne: he wil not bind vp the wounds,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14997:35"/>nor cure the maladies of any, but of thoſe, who are touched and pained with the ſenſe and feeling of the ſame.</p>
            <p>For reproofe of thoſe men and women that are audacious and venturous enough to come before God,
<label type="milestone">

Such doe but take the holy name of God in vaine: they make not praiers of faith, that ſhall preuaile for them; but praiers of ſinne, that ſhall ſtand in record againſt them; being ſinnefull and abominable in Gods ſight. They <hi>draw neere with their lippes,
<note place="margin">Matth 15.8.</note> but their hearts are farre from God:</hi> and therefore in vaine they worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Hence it commeth to paſſe, that many offer themſelues to receiue the Sacrament, the ſeale of the eternall couenant; and come to the word to heare the promiſes of life, and yet depart without all comfort and aſſurance of Gods fauour, becauſe they came not with teares for their tranſgreſſions and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions againſt the Lord; nor with that piercing ſorrow, which would goe as neere them, and bee as effectuall in them, as if they ſhed abundance of teares; becauſe wee will not doe the leſſer which belongeth to vs, God will not doe the greater which pertaineth to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> ſeeing God would haue all to waſh, the beſt as well as the worſt, let vs be inſtructed, if wee would haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and communion with God, to ſearch our hearts, to the intent wee may finde out the hidden corruptions thereof, and bewaile the ſame with a ſound and earneſt lamentation. And then if wee doe but aske mercie, wee ſhall haue it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. For if one of our children haue fallen into ſome great and grieuous fault, wee will not forgiue him, till he firſt humble himſelfe, as the Prodigall ſonne did: if there bee in him no remorſe for the offence committed, but hee continue proud and ſtubborne ſtill; the father ſhould ſpoile his child, if hee ſhould ſhew him fauour: the beſt courſe hee can take with him then, is to carrie a heauie countenance towards him, and a ſtrait hand over him, that ſo hee may recouer him and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14997:35"/>ſaue his ſoule: and euen in like ſort will God deale with vs; where hee loueth moſt, hee will checke and rebuke moſt, till they grow to that reformation which hee requireth, and ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at in their correction.</p>
            <p>Now to the end wee may the better get this holie affection of ſorrow into our hearts,
<note place="margin">Meanes.</note> wee muſt vſe all helps needfull for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And firſt, becauſe it is a ſupernatural worke,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">Pray for it.</note> we muſt intreate the Lord according to his promiſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. to put his ſpirit into vs, and thereby to mollifie our ſtonie hearts, as hee hath couenanted, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. otherwiſe wee may toile out our ſelues in vaine, and after a long and tedious ſtrife bee as farre, nay, farther from a tender heart, then wee were at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as wee muſt craue aſſiſtance from heauen,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo wee muſt vſe the meanes that God hath appointed; namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, to call to minde our many and great offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his maieſtie,
<note place="margin">Aggrauate our ſinnes.</note> and to lay before our eies in as particular manner as we can, our corruptions both originall and actuall, before and ſince our callings: conſidering how grieuous they haue beene; many of them being commited againſt our knowledge, and conſciences; yea and couenants made vnto the Lord for the reſiſting and forſaking of them. Further, we are to recount with our ſelues, of how long continuance they haue beene: how offenſiue, how pernicious and infectious to others; how many we haue poiſoned by them, of whoſe recouery wee are altogether vncertaine: ſome of them (for ought wee know to the contrarie) being already in torments in hell fire, for the ſinnes whereinto wee haue drawne them: and others (perchance) likely enough to goe the ſame way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, if the Lord doe not in mercy preuent them by his grace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and the like meditations, will cauſe our hearts (if they bee not paſt ſenſe and feeling) ſomwhat to relent. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> aggrauate their ſinnes that liued in his time:
<note place="margin">Neh. 9.</note> and ſo did <hi>Dauid</hi> his own corruptions; endeuouring in many words to make them odious in his owne eies:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> acknowledging that hee was conceiued in ſinne, (which was the fountaine of all) and brought foorth in iniquitie: that God requireth truth in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14997:36"/>the inward parts, but hee had beene hypocriticall and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted: that God had taught him wiſdome in the ſecrete of his heart, but hee had put that out of his conſideration, and caſt it behind his backe, when it ſhould haue reſtrained him from all thoſe ill courſes that hee tooke. Theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances, are either plainely expreſſed, or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent neceſſarily implied in that 51. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> whereby hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſet out the hainouſneſſe of his offences, that his own ſoule might abhorre them, and all the world might ſee his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deteſtation of them.</p>
            <p>Another excellent meanes is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not onely with patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
<note place="margin">Suffer admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> but with earneſtneſſe to intreate, the admonitions and reproofes of thoſe, which haue beene, and are acquainted with our courſes: for wee are ſo full of ſelfe-loue, that others may eaſily diſcerne more euill in vs, then wee can eſpie in our ſelues: and thoſe of all other, are the beſt, and moſt faithfull friends, that will mercifully, and wiſely (though ſharpely and roundly) tell vs of our faults: as <hi>Nathan</hi> dealt with <hi>Dauid,</hi> when his heart had beene a long time hardned by lying in ſinnes vnrepented:
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> which priuate admonition of his (as wee may obſerue) was a more effectuall meanes for his rouſing out of that dead ſlumber, then any, or all the publike ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God: as the ſacrifices of the Law, and Sermons of the Prophets &amp;c. which all that while hee had frequented. And ſometime it is found by experience yet ſtill, that a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<label type="milestone">

               </label> and ſound, and wiſe reproofe of a Miniſter of God, or ſome Chriſtian friend in priuate, throughly ſet on, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually applied, hath done that (through Gods bleſſing) that many holy and excellent Sermons could not effect and bring to paſſe, for the reclaiming of diuers from the by-paths of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie; wherein they had a longtime wandred and gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray. Which is not ſpoken, as if this priuate dealing were to bee preferred before Gods publike ordinances: but that wee may haue each of them in due eſtimation: that as we ſhould not <hi>deſpiſe Prophecying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.10. Heb. 13.22.</note> but <hi>ſuffer the words of exhortation</hi> in the aſſemblies of the Saints: ſo we ſhould <hi>admoniſh one an other,</hi> and be admoniſhed one of an other,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>dailie,</hi> in priuate, <hi>leſt any be hardned through the deceitfulnes of ſinne.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Meditate of Gods infinite mercy in Chriſt.</note> when wee by our owne ſearching and examination, and by others plaine and faithfull admonition, haue found out a great ſea of our corruptions, then let vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſeriouſly ponder vpon the infinite mercie of the Lord our God, in giuing vs his dearely beloued ſonne: and the inconceiuable loue of the ſonne, in ſubmitting himſelfe to become a ranſome for vs: and that without any intreaty, deſert, or deſire on our parte: yea, euen then, when wee were his mortall enemies. This was it, that cauſed them, in the 12. of <hi>Zacherie,</hi> ſo to mourne and lament, becauſe they conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what Chriſt had ſuffered in their behalfe. And this ſhould breake and melt our hearts (as it did theirs) that wee wounded and pierced our deere Sauiour by our tranſgreſſions: for the <hi>Chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.5.</note> and by his ſtripes we were healed.</hi> If he would ſhedde his precious blood for vs; why ſhould we thinke it much to ſhedde a few teares ouer him? and ſo the meditation of the ſeuerall ſufferings of Chriſt, and of Gods gracious promiſes made vnto vs, in, and through him, ſhould cauſe our hearts to be diſſolued into teares.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, we muſt as often as fit occaſion is offered,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> goe vnto the houſe of mourning;
<note place="margin">Make vſe of others croſſes</note> where we may be put in minde of our wofull eſtate, by reaſon of our wicked nature and ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cariage, in violating the Lords holy precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and this is commended as the parte of a godly wiſe man by <hi>Salomon,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes;</hi> where it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.6.</note> 
               <hi>The heart of wiſe men is the houſe of mourning: but the heart of fooles is in the houſe of mirth.</hi> And the reaſon why this is a part of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is rendred in the 4. <hi>verſe. It is better to goe to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of feaſting; becauſe this is the end of all men; and the liuing ſhall lay it to his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if others chaſtiſements ſhould affect vs:
<note place="margin">Of our owne</note> much more ſhould Gods correcting hand vpon our ſelues, mooue vs: and and when he ſmiteth vs, wee ſhould ioyne with him, and take his part, and ſmite our owne hearts; and then if Gods ſtroakes on others, or on our ſelues, doe make vs mourne for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious behauiour againſt the Lord, happie and bleſſed are wee: for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, O Lord,

            <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> this is for the ſingular comfort of Gods children. What though they haue been like the people of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and haue liued like beaſts all their life long? yet is there hope that they ſhall not be caſt off: nay, if they can once beginne to rinſe and purge their hearts, though their ſinnes haue beene neuer ſo horrible, and odious, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; they may be aſſured of the free and ful pardon of them al; neither need they make any doubt at all hereof: for if ſuch kind of ſinners might not attaine to this, it were in vaine for the Lord to exhort them to repentance: but wee ſee heere, that though theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> had receiued many bleſſings; heard many inſtructions and threatnings out of the word, and felt many corrections from Gods owne hand, and nothing would driue them from their accuſtomed courſe of rebellion, yet notwithſtanding all this, if now at laſt they would grieue their hearts in good earneſt, and not paſſe ouer the matter with ſome ſleight mourning, (for ſo farre wicked <hi>Saul</hi> went, when <hi>Dauid</hi> had told him of his fault in purſuing him that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent) but ſtriue for a ſoaking, and working ſorrow: if I ſay, they would labour for this, the Lord offers them mercie, ſo that they ſhould foorthwith bee disburdened of the guilt, and freed from the puniſhment of all their former wickedneſſe. For when ſinne is once caſt out of the heart, God hath no quarell againſt the partie; and it can neuer lurk there long, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be fedde with excuſes and allowance.

            <p>This people here had many ontward obſeruations, as doth appeare from <hi>verſe</hi> 12. to the 16. Yet becauſe their ſeruices were not performed in faith and loue; God did vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and deteſt them. They would keepe the Sabbaths, and frequent the ſolemne aſſemblies, but they would learne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: though their bodies were there, their hearts were not there; but either about their buſines in the familie, or their affaires and dealings in the world; thinking how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge ſuch or ſuch an iniurie; how to releeue themſelues in ſuch or ſuch a neceſſitie, or the like, or perchance worſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They would make long praiers, but their hearts were full of wrath, and their minds full of doubting: and ſo in other exerciſes of religion, ſtill they mingled their owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſo much that God could haue no liking of them. Such were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies</hi> alſo, who vſed to preach, to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14997:38"/>giue much almes; to pray, and faſt often; and had a verie ſmoth outſide: for ſo much Chriſt grants them, that they were painted Sepulchres, faire to behold and looke vpon: and graues ſo couered ouer with greenſward, that one might walke ouer them againe and againe, and yet neuer perceiue any rotten bones therein. Notwithſtanding all this, the vengeance of God is denounced againſt none more often and earneſtly by our Sauiour, then againſt that kinde of people, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainely in the Goſpell.
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> And why? becauſe they tooke not away the euill of their works: for which cauſe, the Lord Ieſus tels them,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.15.</note> 
               <hi>Yee are they which iuſtifie your ſelues before men, but God knowes your hearts: for that which is highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, is abominable in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the like, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> laieth vnto the Iewes charge elſwhere,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.13.</note> ſaying, <hi>This people come neere vnto me with their mouth, and bonour mee with their lips, but haue remooued their heart farre from mee.</hi> Hee blameth them not, for that they came not to Church, or that they refuſed to make an outward ſemblance and ſhew of worſhipping him; either in word or deed, (for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were verie forward) but for that they brought a lame ſacrifice, or rather a dead carkaſſe; preſenting before God the outward man, but not caring to bring before him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, which hee chiefely regardeth and looketh after; and without which the other is of no reckning with him, but is eſteemed to bee a vaine and ſinnefull worſhip.</p>
            <p>And the ſame deteſtation of ſuch hypocriticall ſeruing of him, the Lord ſheweth in an other place of this Prophecie. Where firſt hee declareth what kinde of worſhippers he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and delighteth in.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>To him will I looke</hi> (ſath hee,) <hi>euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit and trembleth at my words.</hi> Thus ought all to bee diſpoſed and affected, that expect any fauour from the Lord: that becauſe hee is ſo holie, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and glorious, they muſt come with feare and trembling, through a ſight and feeling of their owne baſeneſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe. Which if they ſtriue to doe, the Lord promiſeth that hee will looke vpon them with a mercifull and gracious eie. Then in the next verſe, hee ſetteth downe what account he maketh of ceremonious worſhippers, that contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14997:38"/>with offering oblations of bullocks, and ſheepe, &amp;c. thinking that God was beholding to them for the ſame: they trembled not at the word, neither were ſorrowfull, nor heauie hearted for their ſinnes: yet becauſe they were at coſte and charges to ſerue God in ſacrifices and incenſe, they thought themſelues as good as the beſt: but the Lord ſheweth there that he condemneth and abhorreth them and their oblations, ſaying, <hi>hee that offereth a</hi> ſacrifice, and doth not offer himſelfe, it's all one as if hee were a murderer (for to that effect are the words) <hi>He that killeth a bullocke, is as if hee ſlew a man:

And as for their incenſe, and bowing downe in Gods houſe, he ſheweth that it is as if they bowed to an Idole, and bleſſed it: it was as hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lothſome in Gods eies, as the moſt vile and monſtrous Idolatrie that was. For hee required of them in thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward oblations, that they ſhould haue ſpirituall affections:

Hee that did bring a beaſt to bee killed, was thereby to profeſſe before the Prieſt, that hee deſerued for his tranſgreſſions, to bee killed himſelfe. Now when hee could ſtand by, and ſee the beaſt ſlaine; with a bold face, and a ſenſeleſſe heart, not trembling at the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his owne wretched deſerts; the Lord profeſſeth that he will neuer looke with a pittifull eye vpon ſuch an one, but eſteeme him as a notorious malefactor, and puniſh him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: and that he was of power ſo to doe, he maketh it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident in that place by this,

            <p>Iudas dealt beſt with Chriſt of all the diſciples in appearance: for when all ſhrunke from him, hee ſtucke to him; came and bowed himſelfe before him; ſaluted and kiſſed him.

<note place="margin">Works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Euils of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> who can cleare himſelfe therein? For if men come vnto Sermons, and offer vnto the Lord their bodily preſence, doe not the moſt thinke they haue acquited themſelues well? Albeit in the meane while they bee altogether negligent in making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for this worke, by ſearching their ſoules to caſt out the leauen of corruption, which wil hinder the powerfull operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word: and by getting that ſight of their wants, that might cauſe them to come with an eager appetite vnto Gods houſe. They ſeldome, or at leaſt very coldly, pray vnto the Lord to giue them an vnderſtanding minde, and a teachable heart to profit by the meanes: but for the moſt part, thruſt in themſelues ruedly with a proud and vnprepared heart, and with vnrulie and diſtempered affections; that when they ſtand in Gods holie preſence, are wandring from the duties in hand, and running after their couetouſneſſe, or after their delights: and ſo if the word flie in at the one eare, it flies out as faſt at the other. And they doe not mingle it with faith, as they ſhould doe, but with theirowne corruptions,
<note place="margin">Hebr. 4.</note> which hinder the effectuall working of it: and ſo it ſeales vp vnto many, their owne iuſt condemnation, in ſteed of being an inſtrument of God for their edification and ſaluation. And as for Gods owne children, in ſteed of thoſe excellent graces that might be thereby wrought in them, it oftentimes hardens their harts, and fittes them for ſharpe correction.</p>
            <p>So for praier, whereas they ſhould lift vp pure hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrath, and without doubting;
<note place="margin">Corruptions in praier.</note> many neuer care what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſacrifice they offer vnto the Lord: but are full of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which diſtracts them, and full of vnbeleefe which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them from hauing intereſt in God bleſſings: and ſo their praiers tumble down againe vpon their heads, and bring vpon them iudgements in ſteed of mercies. They may truly ſay, that they haue ſought for helpe often, and haue had no hearing; but it is long of themſelues: for the ſea is not more

The like may bee ſaid for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: diuers there are that partake of it as often as their neighbours doe; but they are ſo farre from receiuing benefit and comfort therefrom, that it proues hurtfull and vncomfortable vnto them: and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they put not away the euils of this worke.

And beſides all the former, hee ſhall haue more glorie by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs from ſinne, then by healing her from a bodilie infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: and the taking, and eating of the bleſſed Sacrament of the eternall couenant, is much more effectuall to draw ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from Chriſt, then the bare touching of his garment was: and hee is neerer vnto vs now in his gracious preſence, then hee was vnto her then, in his bodilie preſence.</p>
            <p>This wee ſhould beleeue and reſt vpon: and if wee doe not, wee offer vnto the Lord the greater iniurie: for hee is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, but purpoſeth to beſtow that vpon vs in truth, which he makes offer of in ſhew: euen to giue vs as full a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the righteouſneſſe of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as wee had with the corruption of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Euen as the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doe partake of the ſappe of the Vine: and the members of the body, haue life and motion deriued vnto them from the head: ſo ſhall we receiue grace and life from Ieſus Chriſt,

Oh wee haue reprooued them, and told them of their faults ſo often, and ſo earneſtly, and yet there is no reformation, nor amendment of any thing: but looke backe to your ſelfe now, and perhaps the greateſt blame will lie vpon you.</p>

            <p>Therefore, let maſters of families, and parents, (and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe husbands when they are to deale this way with their wiues) be carefull to do this dutie in wiſdome and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in loue and tender affection to the ſoules of the parties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.

            <p>And as maſters muſt heerein looke to themſelues: ſo muſt ſeruants in their places; they muſt beware of eie-ſeruice:

Satan that old ſerpent (whom they ſerue that are thus in bondage to their fond and wretched luſts) hath many cunning wiles, and craftie fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, both to allure them into his ſnares, and to hold them faſt when hee hath intangled them: and this is one amongſt the reſt;
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
               </label> that when one gets, and feeles it comming, hee ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp in him ſuch a luſt after gold and ſiluer, or whatſoeuer they play for, that they cannot make an end in any time. And if any one looſe, hee perſwades him (though indeed there needes not any great adoe to perſwade them, their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions carrying too great a ſway ouer them in this reſpect) to play one game more, to trie if they can recouer that which they haue loſt, and not to let the winners giue ouer with ſuch dammage vnto them, and aduantage vnto themſelues: and ſo let ſlip many a precious houre, wherein, if they were well buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they might get moregood vnto their ſoules, then all the world is worth.</p>
            <p>And as in gaming, ſo in other paſtimes (as they call them) they are ſo exceſſiue in reſpect of time, that in ſteed of the right end of them (which is to quicken and reuiue the ſpirits, and to fit men for matters of greater importance) they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them to a quite contrarie end, and make them meanes to wearie and tire out themſelues: ſo that they are for that day, vtterly diſabled for any worke of religion, or of their callings.</p>
            <p>Yet it is ſtrange to heare how thoſe that carry the name and profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, will ſhift off euerie wholſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and rebuke that is brought againſt them, with this, what? will you not allow vs recreation? but it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of many of them, to their ſhame, what is your voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that talke ſo much of recreation? what ſore labour haue you vndertaken ſo to wearie you, that you ſhould ſtand in neede of ſo much refreſhing? In truth if things were well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, we ſhould finde, that ſuch make their ſports to bee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14997:43"/>their vocation, (if they haue any at all) not their recreation. For they doe nothing elſe, or very little elſe, but eate and drinke, and ſleepe, and play, and ſo conſume their daies, and ſpend the greateſt parte of their life like Epicures, that dreame of no other happineſſe, but of following their delights, and giuing themſelues ouer to beaſtly voluptuouſnes and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie. And whereas recreation ſhould bee vſed onely as phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, they make it their ordinarie diet. If wee ſhould heare a man alwaies inquiring after skilfull Phyſitions,
<label type="milestone">

               </label> and calling for nothing elſe but Phyſicke, Phyſicke; we would preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, certainely this man hath a very ſickly body: and what els can we think of thoſe men, that are ſtil following after vain delights, and in whoſe mouthes there is nothing ſo vſuall, as recreation, recreation, what elſe (I ſay) can wee thinke of them, but this, ſurely theſe men haue very ſickely ſoules. There is very little inward ioy and ſpirituall contentment in that heart, where ſo much is ſought for from theſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things.</p>
            <p>A third euill in recreations, is, inward fretting,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and outward chaſing: eſpecially when they breath out monſtrous oathes,

<label type="milestone">

<label type="milestone">

            <p>Thus haue we ſeene (as particularly as the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) what droſſe of corruption is to be purged away from the ſeuerall actions and duties, wherein vpon ſeuerall occaſions, and according to our ſeuerall callings, we are to be buſied and imployed. Theſe euils therefore we muſt with all conſcionable and faithfull endeauour ſeek to remoue: and that from before Gods eies. For whereas many may haue this conceit: no man can charge me, I will neuer accuſe my ſelfe, and my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will certainly conceale, and keepe all to themſelues, and therefore I need not feare the diſcloſing of my actions and dealings,

            <p>This <hi>Iob</hi> ſets downe as a marke, that hee was no hypocrite, (though his friends iniuriouſly charged him to be ſuch a one) becauſe hee was carefull of thoſe good duties that did pertaine to him in his place, both as hee was a Magiſtrate, and as hee was a rich man; in both which reſpects, hee ſhewed all good faithfulnes; for as hee was a Magiſtrate, hee ſaith, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the poore that cried, and him that had none to helpe him.
<note place="margin">Iob 29.12.</note> The bleſſing of him that was readie to periſh, came vpon mee, and I cauſed the widowes heart to reioice: I put on iuſtice, and it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee: my iudgement was a robe and a crowne, &amp;c.</hi> Neither would hee ſhift off matters to eaſe himſelfe, and to free himſelfe from paines and troubles; but (ſaith hee) <hi>If I knew not the cauſe, I would ſearch it out diligently:</hi> and though the pray were in their hands, nay, as it were in the mouthes of thoſe that were ſtrong, and fierce as Lyons: Yet he ſaith, that <hi>hee would breake theiawes of the vnrighteous man, and plucke the pray out of his teeth.</hi> Hee would aduenture himſelfe for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in a righteous cauſe, though it were with as great danger, as for a man to pull the pray out of the iawes of ſome hungrie and ſauage wild beaſt, that would be ready to deuoure any that ſhould come neere him.</p>
            <p>Then as hee was a rich man,
<note place="margin">Iob. 29. Iob 31.16.</note> hee ſheweth that hee diſpoſed his wealth to that end which God had appointed. <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>a father vnto the poore. I reſtrained him not of his deſire, nor cauſed the eies of the widowe to faile. I did not eate my morſels alone, but the fatherleſſe did eate thereof. And from his youth hee grew vp with mee, as with a father, &amp;c. I ſawe none periſh for want of clothing, nor any poore without couering:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14997:48"/>but their loines bleſſed me, becauſe they were warmed with the fleece of my ſheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, that this faithfulneſſe in a mans owne calling, is a notable teſtimony of an honeſt heart, and of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it appeareth by the ſpeech of our Sauiour, where he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth himſelfe, and his actions vnto his father, ſaying, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Iohn 17.4.</note> I haue glorified thee on the earth:</hi> how prooues hee that? <hi>I haue finiſhed the worke which thou gaueſt me to doe.</hi> Many times men ſet vpon workes which God neuer commanded them to doe, but which their owne fleſh, and Satan bade them do: or if they begin to goe about good workes that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, they doe not goe thorow with the ſame, as Chriſt Ieſus did: and therefore they neither bring glorie to Gods name, nor comfort vnto themſelues by that which they doe: but this is it indeed that will ſtand men in ſteede, when they ſhall come to make their accounts before the Lords iudgement ſeate, if they can truely ſay, <hi>Lord I haue done the worke</hi> that thou didſt appoint mee; I haue beene exerciſed in thoſe buſineſſes and affaires which thou diddeſt enioyne me, &amp; haue gone thorow with the ſame. So, when the Lord Chriſt Ieſus would commend a worthy ſeruant; what is the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that hee hath giuen him?
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> that hee hath faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied thoſe talents and gifts, that his maſter committed vnto his truſt,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.2.</note> vnto his beſt aduantage. And this (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) is required of diſpoſers, <hi>that euerie one be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> That is, that they diſcharge euery one the duties that pertaine vnto them in their places, withall due care, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcionable regard.</p>
            <p>This ſerues for the iuſt reproofe of thoſe that make ſome ſhew of Chriſtianitie,

Many are good neighbours abroad, but bad gonernors at home. They can aduiſe others for the beſt, but they haue no care at all to order their owne families in the feare of God. Many husbands are kind and courteous abroad, but churliſh and vnmercifull to their yoke-fellowes: and to their Children and ſeruants at home. Many wiues will ſeeme religious, who yet are not helps in their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14997:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>obedient to their husbands, fearing to offend them: nor ſeeking in all good and lawfull things to content and pleaſe them. Such maſters, and husbands, and wiues, can haue little comfort of their faithfulneſſe, when they faile moſt in thoſe things, wherein the power of godlineſſe ſhould moſt ſhew it ſelfe; namely in diſcharging a good conſcience where they are tied ſo to doe by the neereſt and ſtrongeſt bonds.</p>
            <p>And this is a great fault in diuers ſeruants, who when they haue gotten a little knowledge of religon, and can diſcourſe of ſome points thereof, begin to thinke that then they haue a diſpenſation to be idle and ſlothfull: headſtrong, and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, teſtie and impatient when they are told of their faults, and the like. Oh this is a wofull vſe that they make of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and hearing the word of God:
<note place="margin">Titus 2.9.10.</note> if they had well obſerued that which moſt concernes them, they ſhould haue found that the Lord commandeth ſeruants, <hi>to pleaſe their maſters in all things, not anſwering againe, and to ſhew all good faithfulneſſe, that they may adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.5.</note> And againe, <hi>Seruants bee obedient vnto them, that are your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to the fleſh, with feare, and trembling, in ſinglenes of your hearts, as vnto Chriſt.</hi> And no leſſe effectuall is that other place of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie. Let as many ſeruants as are vnder the yoke, count their maſters worthy of all honour,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.1.2.</note> that the name of God, and his doctrine be not euill ſpoken off. And they that haue beleeuing maſters, let them not despiſe them, becauſe they are brethren, but rather doe ſeruice, becauſe they are faithfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and partakers of the benefit.</hi> And that was a thing worthy ſingular commendation in <hi>Iacob,</hi> that hee ſerued <hi>Laban</hi> (though a couetous,

For if they did bring a ſpirituall eare to receiue the proofes that are brought from the word, they would bee mroe forcible to bring them to God, then all other meanes could bee to allure them to forſake God, and to embrace this preſent world. Therefore when the Lord would haue men to practiſe any dutie, or to forbeare any ſinne, wee ſee what ſtrong reaſons he bringeth for that purpoſe: as is euident (together with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other places) in the ſecond and in the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.

            <p n="2">2 Another reaſon there is on our part, that hee that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth truely for one ſinne, doth repent as truely for all the reſt: and though none doe particularly know and diſcerne all the errors of this life, yet God will accept of a generall humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, and confeſſion of them, ſo that from both theſe laid together: (that neither Gods iuſtice is vnſatisfied, nor any ſinne vnrepented in thoſe that labour to waſh their ſoules by true and godly ſorrow) it is apparant, that there is no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no not the moſt hamous, that ſhall ſtand in record againſt them, but all ſhall be remitted and couered from Gods ſight, that hee ſhall neuer looke vpon them in anger and indignation for the ſame.</p>

<note place="margin">Againſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</note> that there is a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> where ſome men after this life muſt haue a further purging and ſcouring then heere they haue attained vnto: but ſee heere what the Lord ſaith: Though men haue broken foorth into neuer ſo many abominations, though their ſinnes were as crimſon, and as ſcarlet, yet if they would ſeeke to waſh &amp; cleanſe themſelues by the meanes that God hath appointed, hee giueth them his faithfull promiſe, that they ſhall be made white as wooll, yea white as ſnow, as if they had neuer offended at all. To what end then ſhould men appoint a ſecond waſhing, when God himſelfe hath vndertaken to waſh vs from all our filthineſſe, and from our greateſt corruptions? as hath beene more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared before. What an abſurd thing is it, to imagine, that we muſt goe thorow a ſtrange inuented fire, which may more thorowly purge away the droſſe of our corruptions, as if Chriſt his blood were not ſufficient to make vs white as ſnow! This is but a carnall conceit of mans fooliſh braine: for if fire, and enduring of paines and torments could haue ſcoured off ſinne, the reprobates in hell ſhould haue beene purged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from long agoe. But God alone hath cleane and precious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a skilfull and powerfull hand to effect that worke: and in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, the true and faithfull Witneſſe, telleth vs how all our vncleannes may be couered from Gods eies:
<note place="margin">Reu. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>I counſell thee</hi> (ſaith he to the Church of <hi>Laodicea) to buy of me white raiment, that thou maiſt be clothed, and that thy filthy nakedneſſe may not appeare.</hi> Nakedneſſe there is in the beſt: but Chriſt his righteouſneſſe is that garment which muſt couer it, and then God will neuer in anger and diſpleaſure looke vpon it, but in mercie and goodneſſe looke vpon the holineſſe of his ſonne, wherewith our ſoules are inueſted, and all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities hidden and couered.</p>
            <p>Secondly,

            <p>Many are afraid to aduenture vpon the worke of repentance, leſt they ſhould bee driuen thereby to deſperation: but let vs neuer feare that, though our vncleanneſſe be neuer ſo great; though wee bee ſtained and died from top to toe, within and without, in euery part and power of ſoule and body, by reaſon of our originall corruption, and actuall tranſgreſſions, ſo that all the men in the world cannot take away the foule ſpots and horrible ſtaines of ſinne that cleaue vnto vs, and are ſettled in vs: yet the Lord of heauen, who hath all ſufficiencie of power in his hand, can and will (without any difficultie) purge vs from euery one of our iniquities, by ſprinkling on our hearts the precious blood of his owne ſonne, which is as it were a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne Bath, ordained for the cleanſing of the ſoules of his elect from that contagious leproſie of ſinne, wherewith they are wholly ouer-ſpread. And therefore let none bee diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in regard of his many and greeuous offenſes, ſeeing that the Lord hath entred into a ſure couenant with vs, for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning and healing of them all; who can as eaſily cure the moſt deadly wound, as the ſmalleſt ſcarre: and the harder the cure is, the more hee ſhall bee glorified, in ſhewing foorth the riches of his mercie towards poore ſinners that ſtand in need thereof. Our greateſt extremitie, is Gods fitteſt oportunity.</p>
            <p>Now the chiefe meanes that he vſeth for our cleanſing and ſanctifying,
<note place="margin">Meanes of cleanſing.</note> are two:</p>
            <p>One is the word,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which being receiued into the heart by faith, doth purifie the ſame:
<note place="margin">The word.</note> according to that of our Sauiour to his Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Iohn 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>Now are ye cleane through the word that I haue ſpoken vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another meanes is the Sacrament,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whereby God is ready to conuey vnto vs the merit and vertue of his ſonnes death,
<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> by the effectuall operation of his ſpirit, that Chriſt may be vnto vs holineſſe for our ſanctification,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note> as well as righteouſneſſe for our iuſtification. God doth not offer vnto vs onely the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14997:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>elements, but hee is more willing to giue vnto vs the things ſignified thereby, then any earthly father can bee to giue foode vnto his hungrie child, that crieth for ſome reliefe at his hands when he hath all plentie and abundance whereby to ſupply his need: I ſay, hee is ſo much more willing then any earthly father, as God is kinder then man, and his ſtore more plentifull then mans: and it's leſſe coſt, and leſſe paines vnto him, and yet more for his praiſe to refreſh the thirſtie ſoules of his poore ſeruants, then for a mortall man to ſatisfie the appetite of his hungry child. For (as the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) <hi>Mercy pleaſeth him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah. 7.8.</note> there is none that can take more delight in following after their recreations, and pleaſures that doe moſt affect them, then the Lord doth in ſhewing himſelfe fauourable vnto thoſe that ſeeke mercie and grace from him in thevſe of his ordinances.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> The next thing that might hinder and diſmay them from turning vnto the Lord by ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is, that he is ſo holy and righteous, and his law ſo ſtrict and rigorous, and they ſo ſinfull and rebellious, that it were in vaine for them to goe about to yeeld obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they ſhould neuer attaine vnto it, and therefore as good for them neuer to begin the worke, as not to accompliſh and finiſh the ſame. And thence it is, that a number ſit downe as ſluggards, and neuer ſet one foot forwards in the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, becauſe they imagine that there is a greater difficultie in Euangelicall obedience, then indeed there is: little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Gods meaning is,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> when hee calleth vpon vs to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient: For his purpoſe is not to vrge vs to a perfect fulfilling of the Law, ſuch as was required of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: but onely that wee ſhould doe our beſt endeauour, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to conforme our ſelues to his will, as neere as wee can: if there be a true ſincere loue, and a harty conſent to ſhew our ſelues dutifull and loyall ſubiects to him in all things, it is as much as hee exacteth of vs. The doctrine to be learned from hence is this: that,</p>
            <p>God accepteth of penitent perſons,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>9</label> the will for the deed: as for the fulfilling of the Law in abſolute perfection, that Chriſt alone hath performed: hee hath paid our debt, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14997:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>canceld the band,
<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.</note> and taken away the hand-writing that was againſt vs: Now this onely remaineth for vs, that wee haue a good inclination, and a willing mind, to performe our dutie, and labour to the vtmoſt of our ſtrength ſo to doe; ſeeing and bewailing our manifold imperfections, errors and failings in euery one of our ſeruices: which if wee can doe, God will be as well pleaſed with vs through his beloued ſonne, as if wee had keept the whole Law, without any departing from it at all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right hand, or to left. That which is ſpoken in the matter of communicating vnto the neceſſities of the Saints in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths</hi> (to wit,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12.</note> 
               <hi>if there bee firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not</hi>) holdeth as true in all other ſeruices; that wee are accepted with the Lord, according as wee are inwardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, albeit our actions be not anſwerable to our deſires: for hee that hath a ready minde to doe what hee can, and doth the ſame, would be as ready to doe a great deale more, if his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did ſerue: and therefore the Lord will ſhew his gracious acceptance of that which is done by him, though it bee neuer ſo little, as well as if it had beene a matter of farre greater worth.</p>
            <p>Now that the true purpoſe and intent of the heart, is that which God principally regardeth in his ſeruants, may be made yet more cleare by examples taken out of the Scriptures. We may reade in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> what God ſaith of <hi>Abraham:
<note place="margin">Gen. 22.16.17</note> By my ſelfe haue I ſworne, (ſaith the Lord) becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and not ſpared thine onely ſonne, Therefore will I ſurely bleſſe thee.

Iſaac</hi> was not ſlaine: but <hi>Abraham</hi> withdrew his hand from him, and ſpared him: yet becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to kill him, and made all things ready for the ſacrificing of him, God accounteth it as good, and rewardeth it as well, as if hee had killed him indeed.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Dauid</hi> had but a purpoſe to build the Temple; which worke was afterward laid vpon <hi>Salomon,</hi> and by him perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: yet the Lord giueth him a good teſtimony, and a large reward for his readineſſe that way: hee was content to ſpare him, becauſe hee had beene at great paines before,
<note place="margin">1. Chron. 17.</note> in ſhedding the blood of many enemies of the Church, and ſome remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14997:58"/>yet ſtill to be ſubdued by him: yet this he telleth him for his comfort,
<note place="margin">2. Chron. 6.8</note> 
               <hi>Whereas it was in thy heart to build an houſe vnto my name, thou diddeſt well that thou waſt ſo minded.</hi> And beſides this, hee biddeth <hi>Nathan</hi> to carrie him this meſſage, that <hi>the Lord would build him an houſe, and would raiſe vp his ſeed after him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
               </label> why doe wee thinke hee will haue regard vnto the deed?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe it is his owne worke: and is not the will his worke as well as the deede? that is moſt certaine, for the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Philippians,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> It is God that worketh in you, both the will, and the deed, of his good pleaſure.</hi> And therefore if wee can beleeue that he is pleaſed with our good actions, wee may be as well perſwaded that hee is delighted with good motions, and holy deſires that are ſtirred vp in our hearts by his owne good ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another reaſon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> why God taketh ſuch ſmall things in good worth,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 103. Mat. 3.17.</note> is, becauſe hee is both in name and nature a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, an heauenly father, and therefore hath <hi>compaſſion of thoſe that feare him, euen as an earthly father hath of his child that ſerueth him.</hi> Now hee that is a mercifull, and wiſe, and louing father (as thoſe will bee euer moſt mercifull to others, that haue taſted moſt of Gods mercie to themſelues) when hee ſeeth that his child doth as well as hee can, though it bee but ſimply and poorely, yet hee will ſhew his liking of it, and commend him for it:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
               </label> and ſo will God deale with vs: though we cannot do things perfectly, yet if we do them obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, he wil ſhew his loue &amp; approbation of vs and of our works. When a litle child doth cheerefully aime &amp; ſhoote at the mark which his father propoſeth vnto him, though by reaſon of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he ſhoote very wide and ſhort; Yet it is as well accepted of his father, as if he did hit the white: and the like fatherly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhal we find in God: that if we befaithfull in a little, he wil eſteeme of vs, as if wee performed a great deale more. Indeed when we haue put off the image of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; haue put on the Image of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and haue changed the earth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14997:58"/>for heauen, then wee ſhall not onely obey truely,
<note place="margin">The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heere.

And that was in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and in thoſe of his time: <hi>O Lord I beſeech thee, let thine eare now harken to the praier of thy ſeruant, and to the praier of thy ſeruants, who deſire to feare thy name.</hi> Hee could not ſay, that they did ſo feare his name as they ſhould: but this they could ſay, that they deſired to doe it better: which deſire was a fruite of the grace it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This ſhould inſtruct and incourage vs ſtill to bee doing in the ſeruices and workes of God.

               </label> and haue reſpect to euery commandement of God, and come as neere the marke as we can, the Lord will accept vs according to that wee haue, and not reiect vs for that we haue not.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14997:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>that ſinne might bee ſubdued, and grace planted in ſteede thereof: and it is our continuall griefe, that God ſhould bee ſo gracious, and kind, and liberall to vs, and we can be no more obedient, and loyall, and ſeruiceable vnto him: if (I ſay) wee find ſuch a heart within vs, we need not be diſmaied, but may cheerefully goe on, with full perſwaſion, and vndoubted reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that the Lord will be mercifull vnto vs, and take our obedience in good worth.</p>

(As was more largely taught in the former Sermon, in the end of the 3. <hi>Doctrine.</hi>) For if one ſay that hee deſireth heauen, and yet will neuer frequent Sermons, nor good companie, where hee may bee inſtructed: nor vſe any priuate or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exerciſes of religion, whereby hee may bee edified; he is no more to bee regarded, then a ſluggard that pretendeth that hee meanes to haue a good crop, and yet will neither manure, nor plow, nor ſowe his ground; but when others are labouring, hee is ſleeping, or loytering: as no man will euer looke that the one ſhould haue a plentifull harueſt of Corne; ſo will no wiſe man beleeue that the other ſhall obtaine a plentifull crop, either of grace heere, or of glory hereafter.</p>

            <p>Therefore let this encourage men, if they would haue good things either in right, or in poſſeſſion, to labour to get religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into their hearts: and to bee as much afraide of ſinne, as of miſerie: and as deſirous of grace, as they are of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

               </label> that howſoeuer the wicked of the world ſeeme to thriue beſt, and to enioy great matters, in compariſon of that which good Chriſtans haue; yet in truth their caſe is nothing ſo good as is the caſe of Gods ſeruants, but in the middeſt of al the things that they poſſeſſe, they are very miſerable: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, they haue right to nothing,
<note place="margin">They haue right to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> but are meere theeues and vſurpers, and ſhall anſwer for laying hold of thoſe things, that are in truth none of their owne.

            <p n="2">2 Secondly, as they haue no right to haue any thing;
<note place="margin">They haue the right vſe of nothing.

And when they are moſt loude in their laughter, and ſeeme to bee moſt pleaſant and merry, euen then their mirth is full of hollowneſſe, and diſcontentednes: for let them but haue ſome apprehenſion of death, or of any ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie iudgement likely to befall them: nay let them bee but a little croſſed, and diſgraced by any of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they wil bee ſuddenly diſtempered, and much daunted, and many times fall a trembling, euery ioynt of them,

And if no ſuch thing doe betide them, yet they are ſtill purſued by ſuch enemies, as will ſuffer them to haue no great quietneſſe, nor comfort in the things of this preſent life which they doe poſſeſſe. If we ſhould ſee a Bucke hunted through a greene paſture, where there is much pleaſant graſſe, and many ſweet and pleaſant flowers, and ſprings of water, we would not thinke his caſe very happy, nor that hee had any great inheritance there, when wee perceiued the hounds fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing cloſe at his heeles: yet ſuch is the ſtate of all ſinners: they haue a large and pleaſant walke, perchance in this world, but they are ſtill hunted with many noiſome luſts, of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, and pride, and filthines, and the like: and Satan, and the world haue them euer in chaſe, and ſhall purſue them ſtill, till they haue driuen them into hell it ſelfe, if they alter not their prophane, and wretched courſe of life.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Further,
<note place="margin">Gods curſe is vpon all.</note> they haue the wrath of God lying on their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules, which poiſoneth and inuenometh all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto them. His terrible and vnauoidable curſe ſhall euer cloſe with ſinners: ſo that though they eat and drinke, and wallow in their pleaſures, yet they can finde no ſound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, nor true contentment therein: becauſe being poſſeſſed with hardneſſe of heart, and blindneſſe of mind, and being giuen vp to a reprobate ſence, all things that they haue, are imbittered by their owne ſinne, and Gods heauie vengeance falling vpon them.</p>
            <p>Put caſe all a mans bones were broken, and one ſhould put on him a veluet coate, beſet with pearles and diamonds, in the moſt rich and coſtly manner that might bee: and he ſhould begin to thinke, and ſay, Now I truſt I ſhall bee at eaſe, and ſhall haue no more cauſe of complaint; alas poore man, his rich attire cannot take away his paines: euen ſo fareth it with the vngodly: ſinne hath ſet them out of ioynt; nay it hath ſo wrought on all the powers, and parts of ſoule, and body, that it hath, as it were, chruſht all their bones in peeces: and what ſound peace, reſt, or comfort can they then finde, from all theſe outward things of the world that are caſt vpon them, till there bee ſome cure wrought on their ſoules?</p>
            <p>But it is quite contrarie with Gods children: though they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14997:62"/>be preſſed, and pinched with many diſtreſſes and wants, and driuen to many extremities, and ſtraights, yet they may bee fuller of ioy in the middeſt of their afflictions, then the wicked are in the middeſt of their iollity.
<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were fuller of gladneſſe, and of true contentedneſſe in the dungeon, when their feet were faſt in the ſtocks, then <hi>Herod</hi> was on his throan, hauing all his flatterers and Sycophants about him,

The very teares of the people of God, are ſweeter and more comfortable, then the greateſt ioy of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and wretched ſinners: for the Lord is with his, in mercie and goodneſſe: whereas his face is bent againſt the wicked and impudent:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> and thence it is <hi>that a little that the righteous hath, is better then great riches of the vngodly.</hi> Better is a dinner of greene hearbs, ſeaſoned with the bleſſing of God, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daintie diſhes poiſoned with gods wrath and malediction.</p>
            <p>And albeit, the Saints of God bee ſometimes depriued of theſe tranſitorie things; yet they ſhall neuer bee depriued of Gods fauour: and that want of outward things, ſhall bee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with inward graces. They haue a ſure promiſe, that they ſhal haue ſufficient: and God neuer giueth leſſe then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, though many times he do giue more: and if that which is wanting in droſſe, be paide home in good Gold, we need not much to complain, as if we were looſers by ſuch an exchange.

            <p>And therefore the Prophet telleth them, <hi>if ye refuſe to obey, ye ſhall be deuoured with the ſword:</hi> it is ſure ſome feareful and ſtrange plague or other ſhall fall vpon you, and vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you.

            <p>In this regard they were in great diſtreſſe, and in a ſore ſtrait, yet they thought it better to receiue the Sacrament, though they failed in ſome circumſtances of their preparation, then to omit it vntill the next yeare, hauing wanted it ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereupon they aduentured to eate the Paſſouer; which being ended, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in feare of Gods diſpleaſure, and in commiſſeration of the people that ſtood in danger of Gods plagues and puniſhments, falleth to praier for them, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with the Lord in their behalfe: hee ſaw their great deſire to bee made partakers of it: the paines that they had taken to come vnto <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for that verie purpoſe; and perceiued a ſtrange hand of God in inclining their hearts ſo far, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was hee incouraged to become a mediator as, it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them: and thus he prayed vnto God for them. <hi>The good Lord bee mercifull toward him, that prepareth his whole hart to ſeek the Lord God of his fathers.</hi> And the word that is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>[be mercifull]</hi> ſignifieth thus much in effect, as if he had ſaid, the good Lord pardon and ſupply that which is wanting in him that prepareth his whole heart. And now they wanted not ſo much willingneſſe, as time to prepate themſelues, and therefore he praieth the Lord to bee fauourable vnto them.

            <p>Good Rulers muſt not onely informe thoſe that are vnder them, what they muſt doe, and ſtir them vp to good duties, by wholeſome inſtructions: but they muſt alſo become ſuiters to the Lord for them, that hee would frame their hearts to do as they are taught; and to pardon them where they come ſhort.</p>
            <p>It was well done of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to ſend abroad meſſengers to call the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the worſhip of God: But this he knew was not inough, and therefore hee beſeecheth the good Lord to ſhew himſelfe fauourable vnto them.

            <p>The Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> vnderſtood that this was a dutie,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14997:66"/>when hee accounted the neglect hereof to bee a ſinne againſt God, as in that booke it appeareth that hee did: for when the people were frighted and humbled, both by the words of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and by the myraculous work of God, in ſending extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie thunder and raine in the time of wheate harueſt, and thereupon came vnto <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſaying,

            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe except they ioine petitions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, with inſtructions vnto them,

All plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and watering is in vaine, except God giue the increaſe: and if wee would haue any increaſe, it's good reaſon we ſhould ſeeke it at his hand by praier. Therefore both of them muſt bee ioyned together: wee muſt doe the beſt wee can, and then ſay as <hi>Noah</hi> did,

            <p>This ſerueth for the reproofe of thoſe,

               <note place="margin">Gen. 43.14.</note> Now if he thought it his dutie to pray for them, when they were to come before <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> which was but an vnder-gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> how much more ſhould wee count it our dutie to pray for ſuch as belong vnto our charge, when they are to come before the whole Trinitie; euen before that God, that is the ſoueraigne Lord and King of heauen and earth, full of glorie, and full of maieſtie: how much more (I ſay) ſhould wee deſire, that they might finde fauour in his eies? eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes went but for the food of their bodies, which they might either haue, or want without any extraordinarie hurt vnto themſelues: whereas thoſe that are to be partakers of Gods ordinances, are to be ſuters vnto him for the food of their ſoules, and ſo bee euerlaſtingly ſaued, if they can obtaine it; or elſe take their bane, and bee liable to Gods heauie diſpleaſure, and in danger of iudgement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, in bodie and ſoule, not onely in their life time, but for euer after, if they repent not for their diſorderly, and contemptuous approching vnto him in his holy ſeruices? ſo that there is much more reaſon, wee ſee, that gouernours ſhould bee earneſt with the Lord for thoſe that are vnder their rooffe, then there was for <hi>Iacob</hi> then to be earneſt for his ſons: and therefore let all thoſe bee humbled and reformed, that haue beene ſlacke and negligent in the performance of this dutie.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">

Wee doe not read that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> at any other time dealt ſo earneſtly with God in the cauſe of the people, as at this time hee did: and what mooued
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14997:67"/>him to be ſo importunate now? euen this, that hee ſaw they had hearkened vnto his perſwaſion, and taken great paines to come to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from all quarters of the Land: and being there, hee perceiued that they had ſome ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for their former impietie, and ſome deſire to become better for the time to come: now when hee diſcerned that they came on ſo faſt, and that they were halfe healed already, hee bendeth all the force and ſtrength of his praiers for the obtaining of mercy and fauour for them, and ſo found that good effect that hee deſired and expected. And that was it, that made <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo plentifully and feelingly to poure out his heart before the Lord in praier, and in thankeſgiuing: for when the Princes and the people had offered very largely, and very willingly, <hi>Dauid reioyced with great ioy, and bleſſed;

They ſcarſe dare ſpeake a good word for them, vnleſſe it bee that God would humble them, and conuert them: they cannot pray as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> here doth, <hi>The good Lord bee mercifull vnto him, that prepareth his whole heart to ſeeke the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>good Lord</hi> giue them hearts to prepare themſelues, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtony, and vnbeleeuing, and carnall hearts out of their bodies.
<label type="milestone">

               </label> And indeed many times it is a iuſt iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon ſuch wretched perſons, that his children ſhould haue no heart to pray for them, becauſe (as it is ſaid of <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes) God hath a purpoſe to deſtroy them, or at leaſt grieuouſly to afflict them.

            <p>Now further marke who they bee that hee praieth for: not prophane or careleſſe perſons, but for thoſe that <hi>prepared their whole heart to ſeek the Lord &amp;c.</hi> that is, which laboured with a true &amp; ſincere heart to be partakers of the mercie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, which he made offer of in his holie ordinances.

            <p>So far as any man hath a loue vnto iniquity, and an intent of committing iniquitie, he is tainted with hypocriſie, and doth pollute and defile euery good thing that he medleth withall, and ſo can haue no benefit, but much hurt therefrom.</p>
            <p>If then wee would haue God to meete vs in mercy, we muſt meete him in ſincerity: and if wee would haue him to come vnto vs in goodneſſe, wee muſt draw neere vnto him in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe.

This wee may plainely ſee in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel the ill grounds: there are three ſorts of them mentioned,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14997:68"/>(all profeſſors) that came to the word of life, and yet had no benefit by it: and therefore by a neceſſarie conſequent,

               </label> they could reape as little fruit by the Sacrament. For the word muſt giue life and ſtrength, before the Sacrament can nouriſh and increaſe the ſame. What was the reaſon why they profited not? becauſe they came not with a <hi>good and honeſt heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 8.15.</note> as the fourth ſort of hearers did, who receiued inſtruction, and comfort, and the power of godlineſſe, by the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable hearing of the word. But what is that good and honeſt heart which they are commended for? it is a heart, that doth fullie purpoſe to doe well, though it faile much in that which it performeth: that reſolueth before hand to auoide the euill that ſhall bee reproued, and to doe the good duties that ſhall bee commanded, and to beleeue and reſt vpon the promiſes that ſhall be pronounced, as farre as God ſhall giue abilitie, &amp;c. Now whereſoeuer there is ſuch a ready inclination vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, there will be a bringing foorth of fruit; though not in all alike, yet euery one will doe ſomewhat: and God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for good ground, and honeſt-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that yeeld him but thirtie fold, as well as thoſe that yeeld him ſixtie fold, or an hundred fold: for a leſſe meaſure of fruitfulnes, is an argument of truth, as well as a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore ſhall bee reſpected and rewarded: but as for thoſe that haue naughtie and deceitfull hearts, they ſhall goe away, as bad, or worſe then they came: and whatſoeuer faire colours they ſet vpon their profeſſion for a time, yet ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or latter their hollowneſſe ſhall appeare to their ſhame and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons that make for the confirmation of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That if we would finde acceptance with God, we muſt bring ſinceritie with vs: are theſe,</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, except there bee vprightneſſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wee can haue no

As if there haue beene brawles betweene man and man, there ſhall bee ſome idle and formall reconciliation: they will be friends, and forgiue one another, before they receiue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but if there be any difference betwixt God and them, they neuer looke to the inward parts: ſuch can expect no bleſſing vpon their comming, but may iuſtly feare ſome gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous iudgement, becauſe their hearts are vnſound and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull before the Lord.</p>

<note place="margin">A triall of an vpright heart.</note> let vs take this direction following:</p>

So ſaith <hi>Iames, Purge your hearts yee hypocrites:</hi> but what muſt bee the purgation and receit which they muſt take? <hi>[ſorrow and weepe.]</hi> That man or woman that hath neuer done ſo, is not onely ſtained with hypocriſie, but is a ſinfull hypocrite. All men by nature are full of deceit and guile: and till they ſit as Iudges vpon their owne ſoules, they cannot bee clenſed from the ſame: but when they haue once throughly ſifted themſelues, and by godly ſorrow laboured to purge their conſciences, as neere as poſſibly they can, from all ſecret ſinnes, then though they cannot ſay, I haue no ſinne, yet they may boldly ſay, I allow no ſinne: and therefore I am

               </label> if there bee not good ſeede alſo ſowen thereupon, we cannot expect any crop of grace: all the ſorrow and affliction in the world, without that, can doe vs no good, but rather much hurt: therefore it is ſet downe in the text, as a note of a true heart, in thoſe Iſraelites that came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Paſſouer, <hi>That they did ſeeke the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> in that meanes which hee had ordained for the helping, and healing of them: wherein, if we can imitate them, we ſhall ſpeed as they did, all our breaches ſhall be made vp, and al our deadly diſeaſes ſhall be by degrees healed, and at length fully and perfectly cured.

<note place="margin">Expectation of a bleſſing.</note> that we ſhall aſſuredly finde the efficacy and powerfull operation thereof: and that God will not mocke and delude vs with vaine hopes; but looke what promiſe he hath made in his word, hee will accordingly make good the ſame: and not one word ſhall fall to the ground, of all the good thinges that he hath couenated to beſtow vpon vs. And therefore (as wee are exhorted in the former place to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>) <hi>Wee muſt draw neere in aſſurance of faith,</hi>

Let ſuch be of good comfort: for vndoubtedly the Lord will not ſend them emptie away: their labour ſhall not bee loſt, nor their hope be diſappointed; but they ſhall certainly haue good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe according to their expectation. 1.

            <p>
               <hi>[Though hee bee not clenſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary.]</hi> In theſe words hee preuenteth that feare and doubt of good ſucceſſe, that might ariſe in their hearts for want of preparation: for the Law was, that no vncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould haue anything to doe with the Paſſeouer: now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them were in their vncleanneſſe, becauſe they had not time to purge themſelues according to the legall rites: therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> here ſeeketh to help the matter, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he ſaith thus: I confeſſe Lord, there are diuers cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall circumſtances wanting in our preparation to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: but ſo the caſe ſtood with vs, that wee knew not how poſſibly to helpe it, and therefore Lord be mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in that regard.

For the Lord in his wiſdome conſidered, that it was not through any ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe, or rebellious diſpoſition that hee brake out in that manner: but through the violence of his affliction, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and thorugh the ignorance and indiſcreete cariage of his friends, who dealt very vncharitably, and vnmercifully with him.

Indeed ſhee was but a new commer on, and had not beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed as yet what the danger of a lye was, &amp;c. and therefore notwithſtanding her failing in that particular, ſhee is brought by the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi>

            <p>Againe, this hypocriſie is in our curſed nature, that,

And againe, wee can bee content to haue many good gifts and graces, and would not bee much grieued, if we could get all other that we want: yet we are ready to bee offended, that others ſhould be indued with the like, eſpecially that they ſhould goe beyond vs in doing good, and in receiuing praiſe ſutable thereunto. But this argueth great want of ſinceritie: and if wee bee not humbled for theſe corruptions,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.4.</note> it ſheweth palpable and groſſe hypocriſie; for <hi>loue enuieth not:</hi> but if wee carrie an inward hatred of this euill diſpoſition that is in vs; and labour to abhorre and ſeeke to hinder all manner of ſins,

            <p>A third rule of triall,

<note place="margin">Mat. 6.14.</note> 
               <hi>Forgiue</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>and yee ſhall bee forgiuen:</hi> and therefore being able to doe thus in ſome ſmall meaſure, wee may bee aſſured that the Lord is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed towards vs, and that wee are in his fauour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue hearts without guile in his ſight:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
               </label> for a mercifull heart is alwaies a ſincere heart: whereas hypocrites are of a cruell, and implacable nature: ſo that when any iniury is done vnto them, either in truth or in their imagination, they will ſwell, and fret, and chafe, and vow, and proteſt (or at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and reſolue in themſelues) that they will not put it vp, but one way or other, at one time or other requite it at the full: euer an euill heart, is a proud and froward heart, and can endure nothing leſſe then wrongs and indignities.</p>
            <p>Therefore if God hath wrought ſuch a great worke in our ſoules, as that our hearts are inclined to forgiue and forget a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes that are offered vnto vs, and can pray for our enemies, and long for their conuerſion, and reconciliation; firſt vnto God, and then vnto vs; it is a notable teſtimony that wee are truely regenerated, and ſanctified in the inward, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
            <p>There are none but they are apt to be angry with ſin, either in themſelues, or others: but if wee can ſpend our anger at home vpon the euils of our owne nature,

               </label> and be more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet abroad; not ſtorming ſo much that others are ſo bad, as greeuing that wee our ſelues are no better; happy and bleſſed are wee that haue gotten ſuch a conqueſt of our owne hearts: wee may cheerefully, and comfortably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate at the Lords Table, expecting from Chriſt Ieſus a further increaſe of all holy and heauenly graces. And albeit, others haue greater gifts, and fewer infirmities then we; yet ſeeing we joine with them in the maine matters, wee ſhall be ioyned with them in the fruition of that bleſſing, which God vſeth to beſtow vpon his people; though we bee but buds,
<note place="margin">Iohn 15.</note> yet being in the true vine, we ſhall receiue ſap, and iuice from the root as well as the faireſt, and goodlieſt, and fruitfulleſt bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are in it. And thus much for <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> praier, and the parts thereof.</p>

            <p n="1">1 Firſt, what is the dutie that they muſt performe, which is ſet foorth by <hi>Metaphoricall</hi> ſpeeches, taken from naturall things, and applied to ſpirituall. <hi>Hoe, euery one that thirſteth, come to the waters, &amp;c.</hi> Signifying that as for the preſeruation of their naturall life, they muſt firſt haue a good appetite, and then get meate and drinke to nouriſh and refreſh them: and if they cannot haue it otherwiſe, muſt buy it: and if it be not to be gotten at an eaſie rate, they muſt be content to goe to the price of it: ſo hee that would haue grace, and haue the life thereof continued, and the vigor therof increaſed in his ſoule, muſt get an hungrie and thirſtie deſire after it, and bee at coſt to procure it, though neither by ſiluer, nor gold, nor any charges of that kind, as ſhall after be ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, reaſons whereby the ſame is enforced.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt whereof, is drawen from the hurt that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue if they did not follow his direction: they ſhould miſſpend their mony, and their labour, and bee neuer the neerer to the

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond reaſon, is taken from the benefit that they ſhould find by attending to his exhortation, <hi>to eat that which is good, and to bring their ſoules to delight in fatneſſe:</hi> namely, that all their needs ſhould bee ſupplied, and their miſeries cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: in briefe, their <hi>ſoules ſhould liue,</hi> both the life of grace, and of glorie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Hoe, euery one that thirſteth.]</hi> In that hee calleth none to partake of the holy things of God, but thoſe that are thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The doctrine is: that,</p>
            <p>The thirſtie ſoule alone hath intereſt in the graces of God,
<label type="milestone">

            </p>
            <p>Now the reaſons of this point are theſe:

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, no man hath any warrant to reſort vnto the meanes of godlineſſe, but onely ſuch as were before mentioned: for,

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14997:78"/>and affections that doe at any time ariſe in their hearts. Theſe wretched men are in a wofull caſe; for they ruſh vpon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things of God, without any commiſſion; and therefore without expectation of good from them. And howſoeuer they may talke and brag of their profiting by the word, yet God that ſeeth and ſearcheth their hearts, eſteemeth of them, but as of dogs and ſwine, that prophane his holy things. If they would bee partakers of the water of life, they muſt bee thirſtie: and if they would eate of the bread of life, they muſt bee hungrie: otherwiſe, though they be preſent in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and heare the word preached, and ſee the wine powred out, and the bread broken before their eies at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lords Supper, yet they can haue no hope that they ſhall haue one drop of Chriſt his blood, to waſh away their ſinnes, but may rather expect the viols of his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to conſume their bodies and ſoules: and it is a iuſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God vpon ſuch prophane and irreligious perſons, that when they come to the Sermons &amp; to the Sacrament, they get no good, but rather much hurt therby: and haue their luſts ſtronger, their hearts harder, and their minds far more blind and vncapable of any good knowledge, euery day then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But what is the reaſon heereof? (may ſome demand) Is not the word of God mighty to beate downe the ſtrong holds of the deuill? and is not the Sacrament powerfull in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and able to worke great things?</p>
            <p>Yes they are ſo: and why then haue ſuch no profit by them? becauſe they are abuſers and prophaners, and not meet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers of the ſame: becauſe they come not with any prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or deſire of a bleſſing vpon the meanes, but for cuſtome and faſhion, that they might not ſeeme to bee ſo bad as indeed they are: nor to ſet ſo light by the holy ordinances of God as in truth they doe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for inſtruction.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> If wee would bee welcome to Chriſt Ieſus, when hee inuiteth vs to feaſt with him, then let vs get a good ſtomacke to feed on ſuch cheere as he offereth vnto vs. Otherwiſe, if wee glut our ſelues before wee come to his Table, and be onely looking on thoſe dainties, on which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14997:79"/>others are feedings, it will not bee well taken at our hands, but wee ſhall be as diſtaſtefull vnto the feaſt-maker, as his prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vnto vs: and thoſe things which are vnto others the ſauour of life vnto life, ſhall proue vnto vs the ſauour of death vnto our eternall deſtruction, if our repentance doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent Gods iudgement. If Gods owne children comming care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and vnpreparedly cannot eſcape Gods hand, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. then what ſhall become of thoſe vngodly ones, who come not onely negligently, but altogether prophanely: and ſo, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the ſacred ordinances of God? <hi>(for to the vncleane, all things are vncleane)</hi> ſurely if iudgement begin at Gods houſe, there is nothing remaining for vngodly men, but a fearefull expectation of wrath and vengeance to be powred out vpon them in full meaſure. In which regard it ſtandeth vs vpon to looke vnto our hearts before hand: and to the intent wee may come with this ſpirituall appetite, the want whereof is ſo offenſiue vnto God, and dangerous vnto vs, let vs vſe all good meanes for the obtaining of it: as</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Meanes to get a ſpiritual appetite.</note> to purge away that which may annoy our ſtomacke and kill our appetite: and what that is, <hi>Peter</hi> telleth vs when hee ſaith;

               <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all maliciouſneſſe, and all guile,
<note place="margin">Allovv no ſin. 1 Pet. 2.21.</note> and diſſimulation, and enuy and euill ſpeaking, as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, ſo long as you giue place vnto,

And therefore when we finde in our ſelues dulneſſe and deadneſſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe vnto good duties; let vs conclude for a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that wee ſtand in need of Phyſicke for the purging of our ſoules: for ſinne worketh on our hearts, as ill humors doe in our ſtomacks; it maketh vs to loath all ſpirituall food, and all meanes of refreſhing. And this take for an vndoubted truth, which though our mouthes will not confeſſe, yet our hearts muſt needs acknowledge: when wee haue no deſire to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14997:79"/>heare the word preached, or to receiue the Sacrament when it is to bee adminiſtred, there is ſome ſinne or other not thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie repented of, which ſo cloieth the ſoule, that it cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thoſe holy exerciſes: and as our hearts are more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by godly ſorrow,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> ſo will our hunger and thirſt after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and the meanes thereof, bee ſtill increaſed in vs. This then is the firſt rule that wee muſt obſerue for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſpirituall appetite, <hi>viz.</hi> to put away the practiſe of all croſſe euils, and the allowance of all infirmities, great or ſmall.</p>
            <p>A ſecond is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that wee muſt endeuour to know our owne miſery, what wee are by nature,
<note place="margin">See thy miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> and by deſert in regard of our great and greeuous offences: that ſo being poore in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wee may ſigh and cry for grace; whereas thoſe that are proud in ſpirit, care not for it. We ſee this by common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the perceiuing and feeling of greeuous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſes and diſtemperatures in the bodie, will driue men to the Phyſitian to intreat for phyſicke, that ſo their ſickneſſe may be cured: and in like ſort, the diſcerning and deſcrying of the lothſome and noiſome corruptions wherewith our ſoules are infected and indangered, will driue vs vnto the Lord to craue mercie and grace from his owne meanes, that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities may bee fully pardoned, and our ſinfull nature ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie healed. For when nothing is more irkſome vnto vs, nor more feared of vs then ſinne; then nothing is more deſireable with vs, nor more deſired of vs then grace.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if (in the third place) wee conſider the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof: how it bringeth with it freedome from all euill;
<note place="margin">Conſider the excelency of grace.</note> both from the guilt of ſinne, and from the puniſhment of ſin: and withall the enioyment of all bleſſings needfull for body or ſoule, for this life, or that which is to come. If (I ſay) the ſetled meditation hereof doe once ſinke into our hearts, it cannot but ſet our affections on fire, with an ardent and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of the ſame. Nothing makes vs ſo weake and cold in hearing the word, or communicating of the Sacrament, as that wee haue not ſufficiently taſted how good the Lord is.

               <hi>[Come, I ſay, buy wine, and milke.]</hi> And verſe 2. <hi>[Eat that which is good, and let your ſoules deligt in fatneſſe.]</hi> The drift of all theſe borrowed ſpeeches is to ſhew, that God offereth vnto, and will beſtow vpon the faithfull that ſeeke vnto him, ſuch ſpirituall good things, as ſhall much comfort, and refreſh their hearts, and make their ſoules as it were fat and well liking. Whence ariſeth this doctrine:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> that,</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer commeth to Chriſt Ieſus in the religious vſe of his ordinances,

Are they ſtrong men, yet wearied out with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and temptations? here is bread that wil ſtrengthen their fainting hearts.

            <p>This doctrine is further illuſtrated and proued vnto vs out of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi>

Some are as it were driuen away by ſtrong corruptions, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptations: thoſe hee <hi>will bring againe,</hi> though they be caried neuer ſo far. Others haue been cruſhed and broken with many ſorrowes and miſeries, euen with one breaking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

So that wee ſee, euery one according to his need, ſhall receiue comfort and reliefe from him: and there are reaſons hereof.</p>

And ſo are theſe words expounded in this very Chapter verſe 7. <hi>Let the wieked forſake his waies, and the vnrighteous his owne imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c.</hi> Many forſake ſome ill waies, but not their owne: or if they doe leaue their olde waies and works outwardly, yet they doe not forſake their owne imaginations: but to leaue anothers ſinne for the procuring of this pearle, is as if one ſhould buy cattle, or grounds, &amp;c. with another mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which is plaine theeuery, and will not go for currant pay: the Lord would haue all penitent ſinners, both <hi>to forſake their owne waies and their owne imaginations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond thing in buying, is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that wee muſt receiue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the thing bought:
<note place="margin">Receiue and retaine grace.</note> and ſo would God haue vs to hold faſt grace when wee haue got it. Therefore the wiſe man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs, <hi>buy the truth, and ſell it not: likewiſe wiſdome, and inſtruction, and vnderſtanding.</hi> Wee may chaffer for other things as we will, buy and ſell, and ſell and buy, &amp;c. but heere wee muſt not doe ſo: when once wee haue obtained heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wiſdome, and gotten religion in our hearts, wee muſt get as much increaſe to it daily as wee can, but neuer let goe any of that we haue. And thus much for buying, and the things to be obſerued therein.</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing required in the text, is, that wee muſt <hi>eat,</hi> and this ſtandeth in excellent proportion with naturall food. If a man come where there is great ſtore of meat, and varietite of choice wines, and he ſee others haue a notable appetite, and himſelfe none; all the cheere that is ſet before him will doe him no good, but rather vexe, and trouble him: euen ſo it is in the ſpirituall feaſt:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.24.</note> and therefore Chriſt exhorteh vs ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to feed vpon him: <hi>take, eat</hi> (ſaith hee) ſhewing vs what that is, <hi>viz. to beleeue in him:</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14997:82"/>wee can haue benefit by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Without ſiluer.]</hi> Hence wee ſee that God offereth vs the greateſt, and moſt excellent things without <hi>money or money worth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt things are beſt cheape.

<note place="margin">From his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> We are too ready to boaſt now when wee are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, ſanctified, and ſaued of his free grace, and not by our owne workes: in that God puts life and ſtrength into vs to be working inſtuments of our owne happineſſe, though not of our iuſtification; what then ſhould wee doe, if God ſhould make vs our owne Sauiours, and propoſe heauen vnto vs as a price, bidding vs winne it, and weare it?</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> grant that God were deſirous of ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from vs in regard of that kingdome which hee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs,

            <p>Thirdly, if wee had ſomewhat to giue, yet it were in no ſort correſpondent to that which wee ſhall receiue:

            <p>For inſtruction,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> though we find no maner of goodneſſe or worthineſſe in our ſelues, yet that ſhall bee ſo farre from being any hinderance vnto vs that we ſhall haue the ſight of it, and humiliation for it, it will rather further vs, then hinder vs: for <hi>bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth 5.</note> God is not like one that keepes an ordinarie, where euery one that ſitteth at table muſt buy his ſhot: but hee is a royall feaſt-maker that keepeth open houſe for all commers and goers: and hee paies beſt that ſeeth hee hath nothing at all to pay, and is thereby brought out of all conceite with himſelfe. And this ſhould put an anſwer into our mouthes againſt Satans obiection, that wee haue nothing to ſatisfie God for our offences againſt his maieſtie, nor for his mercies offered vnto vs: wee neede not any ſuch matter of ſatisfaction: becauſe God would haue vs buy and eate freely without mony, or mony worth; and our humble and thankefull acknowlegement of this his bounty and liberalitie, is all the ſatisfaction that he looketh for at our hands.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Many things there bee that make ſhew as if they could doe it,
<note place="margin">Grace onely contents the mind. 1. Tim. 6.6.</note> but the truth is, all will come to ſhort, and bee found too weake for the effecting of it.

               <hi>therewith to bee content.</hi> And the reaſon of the doctrine is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe grace onely repaires the image of God, (the loſſe whereof was the cauſe of all our woe) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>We all behold as in a mirrour the glory of the Lord with open face, and are changed into the ſame image from glorie to glorie,
<label type="milestone">

                  </label> as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> This is the vertue of the word, that whereas looking into other glaſſes, we ſhall ſee our owne faces, therein wee may behold Gods face: and not onely ſo, but ſeeing and miſliking our owne deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhall inſteede thereof receiue by degrees a glorious viſage, and be transformed into the image of God himſelfe, which there wee doe behold: and this image was it which wee loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and with all ſond contentment: and this may we recouer againe in Chriſt through the hearing of the word, and with it true peace, and ſetled comfort. Let a man haue the command of all the world, before he haue Gods image ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpon his ſoule, hee ſhall haue a reſtles heart, becauſe hee hath a wicked heart: he ſhall bee like a beaſt, nay, worſe then a beaſt. <hi>Adam</hi> after his eating of the forbidden fruit, had his abod in Paradiſe for a while: but he found that a hell, which was formerly as it were an heauen vnto him: and why? becauſe hee had loſt Gods image, and conſequently the ſweet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his fauour, which before made all comfortable vnto him.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:14997:83"/>
            <p>Secondly, nothing can take away ſinne but grace;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> now whereſoeuer ſinne taketh vp the place, it expels all quietneſſe from thence. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.21.</note> For when the mind is full of error, and the heart full of luſt, there muſt needes bee a great confuſion and diſtemper in the whole man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, vntill grace enter into the heart, and rule there,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Satan hath the dominion, and ruleth there as a tyrant, at his owne will and pleaſure. If hee doe but ſtirre a wicked man to any ſinfull practiſe, hee is foorthwith readie to yeeld vnto him: if hee doe but bid him ſpue out the venome of his poiſoned ſtomacke, hee preſently breaketh foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cruell and bitter ſwearing, or curſing, or railing, &amp;c. ſo that it may truely bee ſaid that <hi>wicked mens tongues are ſet on fire of hell:</hi> and what reſt then can there bee in that ſoule,
<note place="margin">Iames 3.6.</note> which is ſo poſſeſſed by Satan, who will neuer ſuffer his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to deſiſt from inuenting, or executing ſome miſchiefe or other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> there can be no contentednes in a graceleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe God and he are at warre: for vntill ſuch time as men be iuſtified by faith, <hi>they haue no peace with God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore non with their owne conſciences: and what eaſe or reſt can bee vnto them, that haue ſuch a worme, as is a guilty, and accuſing conſcience, alwaies gnawing within them, and ſuch a racke euer and anone (when God will) torturing and tormenting them? ſurely if grace and peace doe euer goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the Scripture manifeſteth, then where grace is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, peace cannot bee preſent, and ſo the ſoule muſt needes be deſtitute of all true contentment.</p>
            <p>Forthe reproofe of thoſe that (as the Prophet ſaith) diſquiet themſelues about a vaine ſhaddow:

If they had gained all that they ſeeke for, it could doe them no good: for all is but <hi>vanitie, and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> a bruite beaſt is farre happier then they: and well had it beene for them, if they had neuer beene borne: for what <hi>ſhall it profit a man to winne the whole world and to looſe his owne ſoule?</hi> to bee a drudge to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14997:84"/>baſe luſt, to waſte and conſume his wit, and ſtrength, and al, and then to haue hell for his paines? yet how buſie are moſt men in digging for droſſe, and refuſing gold; in ſeeking earthly things, and deſpiſing heauenly? but what will be the euent? <hi>Such as truſt in lying vanities, forſake their owne mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For inſtruction,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that wee ſhould not follow after chaffe, and exerciſe our ſelues in things of no worth, which will make vs neuer the better, or honeſter, though wee haue them in neuer ſo great abundance: but let vs labour for godlineſſe which will free our hearts from diſcontentment, and repleniſh them with true peace and laſting comforts.</p>

            <p>But howſoeuer theſe that were firſt bidden, would not come to the ſupper, yet the Lord would not bee vnfurniſhed of gueſts, and therefore he ſends his miniſters vnto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which ſate in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhaddow of death, who made their vſe of Gods meſſage, and came aboundantly vnto the feaſt, ſo that the wedding was furniſhed with gueſts, ſome good, and ſome bad. Thus farre the meſſengers had good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that multitudes made profeſſion, as if they were deſirous to liue vnder Chriſt his gouernment, and to feede of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, though many of them did it with falſe and hypocriticall hearts.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſhewed what the meſſengers did, our Sauiour next declareth what the King himſelfe did; the place being filled with gueſts,
<note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> 
               <hi>[hee came to ſee the gueſts,]</hi> implying, that when men begin to make profeſſion, God vſeth a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch and examination then his miniſters can doe: for they can but iudge of men by their actions, but the Lord dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth immediatly with their hearts and conſciences. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added, that when he came in, <hi>hee ſaw</hi> (that which the Miniſters did not) <hi>[a man which had not on a wedding garment]</hi> where wee muſt not conceiue that their was but one ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (for it is afterwards ſaid, that <hi>many are called, but few are choſen, verſ.</hi> 14.) but this is the meaning, that if there be but one hypocrite amongſt many thouſands God will finde him out, and ſingle him from among the reſt.</p>
            <p>The partie being thus taken, the Lord falleth to an examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of him, [<hi>Friend</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how cameſt thou in hither?</hi>] that is, how dareſt thou come to the royall table of ſo glorious a King <hi>[and haſt not one a wedding garment?]</hi> that is hauing no repentance for ſinne; no freedome from the guilt, or from the power of ſinne; nor any ſauing grace at all: how is it (I ſay) that thou ſhouldeſt preſume to come into ſuch a place and into ſuch a preſence, hauing made no better preparation?</p>
            <p>When God began thus to examine him in his owne perſon,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14997:85"/>it is ſaid <hi>[hee was ſpeechles]</hi> hauing an ill cauſe and a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, hee had nothing to ſay for himſelfe.

Further they are bid to <hi>[take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way]</hi> to wit, from hauing communion with God, with his Saints or Angels; he muſt be taken from the place and meanes of all comfort and peace, and happineſſe: and is that all? nay (ſaith God) <hi>[caſt him into vtter darkeneſſe]</hi> that is, into hell, a place of all miſerie and woe, which is implied by vtter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: a fit puniſhment for ſuch kind of perſons; for ſeeing they are full of ignorance, and of ſpirituall darkeneſſe while they liue, God hath prouided that they ſhall haue enough of it; they ſhall bee caſt into a place of vtter darkneſſe, where there ſhall be nothing but horror, and anguiſh. And yet if this were all, their ſtate were the more tollerable: but this addeth vnto the miſerie of the place, that they ſhall bee very ſenſible of that miſerie: which is intimated, when it is ſaid, <hi>[there ſhall bee weeping]</hi> not ſuch weeping as many times befals men here, when the teares of their eies abate the anguiſh of their hearts: but ſuch weeping as is ioyned with <hi>[gnaſhing of the teeth]</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that they ſhould not onely haue ſorrow and griefe, but ſuch as ſhould bee mingled with deſperation, and with horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vexation, and torture: not ſuch as ſhould bee an eaſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſoules, but rather an addition vnto their woe.</p>

            <p>And the reaſon why the Lord doth challenge vnto himſelfe this title,

The holy Ghoſt himſelfe giueth this aduice concerning an earthly Ptince, that if any bee to ſit at table with a great Ruler,
<note place="margin">Prou. 23.1.2.3</note> hee ſhould looke vnto his carriage, and reſtraine his appetite, and not behaue himſelfe rudely and vnmannerly: now if this bee a point of wiſedome, when a man is to feaſt with one that is farre his ſuperiour, to waſh his hands, to haue reſpect of his apparell, and if hee haue any ſuit better then another, to put that on; and in no ſort to carry himſelfe diſorderly, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming ſuch a preſence: if (I ſay) a man would, and ſhould deale thus before an earthly Prince, that if there be any failing can but giue him a rebuk and check, or inflict vpon him ſome

            <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> this is for ſingular comfort vnto all Gods people, ſeeing the Lord their God is the onely Monarch of the world, that exerciſeth his kingdome from generation to generation, this ſhould ſtrengthen them againſt all croſſes, and loſſes, and troubles, and temptations, that though men would toſſe them vp and downe, and trample them vnder their feet, and for that end doe euermore plot and practiſe againſt them, yet it ſhall goe well with the righteous, for the Lord raigneth ouer their moſt mortall aduerſaries: and though the times change, and mens affections change, yet their king is vnchangeable; the ſame for euer, in mercy and goodneſſe towards all his true hearted Subiects: hee hath turned euery thing to the good of his Church heretofore, and ſo will he deale with his faithfull ſeruant ſtill euen to the end of the world.

            <p>Firſt, for reproofe of thoſe, that becauſe they are admitted by the Miniſter, and allowed amongſt men, and iudged to bee Chriſtians, as men that can bee touched for no groſſe ſinne;

            <p>The next vertue which wee muſt put on, is <hi>[kindneſſe]</hi> wee muſt not be fierce, nor froward, tart nor ſower in our ſpeeches or cariage, but be affable and amiable in our conuerſation, that ſo we may not diſcourage, nor diſcountenance thoſe that haue to ſpeake or deale with vs.</p>
            <p>But how may we attaine to this <hi>kindneſſe?</hi> get <hi>[humbleneſſe]</hi> which is the next vertue: for whence commeth it to paſſe that men are ſo harſh and rough, ſo loud and full of crying in their ſpeeches? that very true reaſon is, becauſe they are proud: therefore the ſame mind ſhould bee in vs, that was in Chriſt Ieſus, who was ſtill ready to beare with infirmities, and to pray for his ſoreſt aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>The next grace is <hi>[meekeneſſe]</hi> which conſiſteth in this, that wee bee not buſie and violent in our owne priuate matters, but content to part with our owne right, ſo farre as Gods

<note place="margin">How it muſt bee gotten.</note> we muſt know that three things are to be performed.</p>
            <p>The firſt is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">Put off our ragges.</note> that we muſt put off our owne filthy and rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged cloathes, to wit, our ſinfull and corrupt natures, and our bad and vile conuerſation, as the Apoſtle willeth the <hi>Epheſians, Caſt yee offeoncerning the conuerſation in time paſt,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.22.</note> the old man, which is corrupt through the deceiuable luſts.</hi> This then is the firſt dutie, by ſound and hearty repentance to make a riddance of all groſſe ſinnes, and to purge our ſelues as much as poſſibly we can from all infirmities: for certaine it is, that the wedding garment can not be obtained, vntill wee bee fit for the ſame. The old man and the new will not agree together. Wherefore when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> exhorteth men to come and buy,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.5.7.</note> &amp;c. he ſaith, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his waies, and the vngodly his own imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp;c.</hi> now then we forſake them, when with purpoſe of heart wee cleaue vnto the Lord, and depart from iniquitie: and that is as farre as any man huing can goe, to intend and deſire to doe all good duties, and to leaue the contrarie euils.</p>
            <p>The next thing required of him that would buy this white raime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <note place="margin">Deſire it.</note> that he muſt much eſteem, and deſire it for the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſoule alone ſhall be ſatisfied with good things. Now that we may get this ſpirituall affection,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1.</note> we muſt labor to haue a ſight of our miſerable eſtate while we are naked and deſtitute of this raiment; and of our happy caſe when we ſhal be adorned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which being well conſidered of, will make vs more to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, then all the treaſures of the world.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:14997:90"/>
            <p>Thirdly, he that would bee a good chapman, and procure himſelfe theſe heauenly robes,
<note place="margin">Seek it where it may be had</note> muſt come to the places and ſhops where he may buy and haue choice for his mony: which are, where the word is powerfully preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments duely adminiſtred. Thence muſt theſe robes be fetcht whereby all naked ſoules may be couered, and the moſt defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med creature may be beautified:
<note place="margin">Iames 1.18. 1. Cor. 10.16.</note> the word is it which worketh grace and together with the Sacraments doth continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſame: ſo that thereby the Lord conueieth vnto vs whatſoeuer legacies Chriſt hath deſerued for vs. And thus we ſee how the wedding garment may bee come by: our owne ragges muſt be reiected, this muſt be deſired and ſought for where it is to be found.</p>
            <p>A third vſe of this point,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> may bee for an exceeding great comfort vnto them, that haue put away their ſinnes by godly ſorrow, and haue gotten an appetite to the food of their ſoules, they may come as welcome gueſts, and ſuch as haue put on the wedding garment.</p>
            <p>This is for terror vnto thoſe hypocrites,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>4</label> who though the Lord doth call vpon them, and profer them his ſonne, and his ſpirit and his kingdome, yet they will not part with any ſinne, for the obtaining of theſe excellent things; but haue their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites ſo taken vp with earthly things, that they haue no mind to ſpirituall things, neither wil they come to the meanes, nor repaire to the market, where this royall cloathing is to be had; but abſtaine from the word, and eſpecially from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carment. Theſe are much to be condemned and ſharply to be rebuked as deſpiſers of the holy things of God.</p>
            <p>Oh, but one liues in malice, an another in vncleaneſſe, &amp;c.
<label type="milestone">

            <p>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 12.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>4</label> 
               <hi>[Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?] Doctrine.</hi> When God hath to deale euen againſt ſinners,
<note place="margin">God deales in a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner euen with ſinners.</note> yet hee dealeth in good and peaceable termes. <hi>Friend</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> what warrant hadſt thou thus to abuſe my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and mine ordinances? Thus God debateth the matter with him peaceably and quietly, and conuinceth him of his fault before he condemne him for it. So hee dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> when hee had eaten the forbidden fruit, and thereupon fled from God, and hid himſelfe amongſt the trees of the garden, <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>where art thou?
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.9.</note> q. d.</hi> why doſt thou flie from mee and leaue the place of thy calling? <hi>Haſt thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded that thou ſhouldeſt not eate?</hi> Hee comes not vpon him in violence or furie, but quietly cals him by his name, and in coole maner reaſons the matter with him. In like manner deales Chriſt with <hi>Iudas, Friend, betraieſt thou the ſonne of man with a kiſſe?</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>Iudas,</hi> howſoeuer this kiſſe may ſeem to proceed from your loue, yet indeed it is otherwiſe, as being appointed as a token to deſtroy me, that ſo I may be apprehended, and condemned, and put to death; this is not plain &amp; faithfull dealing with your maſter.</p>
            <p>The reaſons, why God taketh this courſe: are,</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> becauſe this milde and gentle dealing maketh men ſee their faults more euidently: whereas paſſionate, haſtie and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſpeeches doe either diſcourage, or imbitter the heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if there be proceeding to puniſhment, the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher is much cleared by this meanes: for when the offence is quietly laid open to the view of the offender, ſo that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confeſſe his guiltineſſe, then muſt hee needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that hee is iuſtly and equally dealt with when punniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is inflicted vpon him.</p>
            <p>This is for our imitation, that if wee would haue any partie ſet downe and humbled for his ſinne; we ſhould endeauour in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14997:91"/>the quieteſt and beſt maner to conuince him of his fault. Vſe as hard arguments as we will (for ſo the Lord doth) but withal look that we vſe ſoft ſpeeches: for that is the way to make men thinke hardly of themſelues; whereas the contrary will cauſe them to thinke hardly of vs. And heere are ſuch to be blamed as when any thing is diſtruſtfull vnto them, are preſently hot and boiſterous, and loud, and crying: and ſo rather hurt the eare by the loudneſſe of their voice, then helpe the heart by the force of their reproofe: whence ariſe theſe two inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. Firſt, that the partie lookes not ſo much to his owne failing, as to their paſſion: and ſecondly, as hee is vnconuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſo they are not eſteemed: but though they haue the right on their ſide, yet they looſe the due regard of their cauſe &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of their perſons. And therefore the Apoſtle telleth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> that the ſeruant of God muſt not <hi>[ſtriue]</hi> but <hi>muſt be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards all men:</hi> hee muſt not be clamorous and violent,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.24.25</note> but <hi>ſuffer euill men patiently, inſtructing them with meekeneſſe that are contrary minded, &amp;c.</hi> for this is the way, if there bee any, to bring them to ſound repentance that they may come out of the ſnares of the diuell. This (I ſay) is the way, to let them ſee good reaſons againſt their ſins, and a good affection towards their perſons: theſe are the beſt helps, and hereby we ſhall be ſure to pleaſe God; and if the partie will euer bee broken, it muſt be by the weight of good arguments, preſſed in meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wiſdome, and proceeding from a mercifull heart.</p>
            <p>But they are vile and wicked perſons with whom I am to deale, ſuch as deſerue little mildneſſe: Bee it ſo?
<label type="milestone">

               </label> yet wee ſee here when God was to reaſon with a reprobate that was ready to bee turned into hell, hee proceedeth calmly and quietly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this is for conſolation.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Will the Lord giue ſuch good tearmes vnto repropates that are to be caſt into hel fire? then ſurely hee will much more vſe mildneſſe towards his people: if Gods enemies haue good wordes from him,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14997:92"/>then what may his friends expect at his hands?</p>

<note place="margin">Sinners ſhall to be put ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> when they are to deale with men like themſelues, yet when God commeth to examine and ſift their conſciences, they ſhall haue nothing to ſay for themſelues.</p>
            <p>This is to bee obſerued in <hi>Iudas,</hi> that though hee were very ſuttle, and a notable cunning hypocrite, yet when the Lord wakened his drouſie conſcience, he brake foorth into a plaine confeſſion, <hi>I haue ſinned, betraying innocent blood.</hi> Hee had no manner of defence or Apologie for himſelfe in the world.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this point is,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> becauſe the conſcience is the Lords officer, and it cannot but ſpeake truth when God will haue it, through the light of knowledge which God hath put into euery mans ſoule by nature: and that is the ſoreſt and ſharpeſt accuſer that can be.</p>
            <p>Further,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Lord can ſet all their works in order before them, and write them as it were in great letters, that a man may runne and read the ſame.</p>
            <p>If then we would be able to ſtand before the Lord at the laſt dreadfull day of iudgement,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> when the bookes ſhall bee laid open, and euery man ſhall bee iudged according to his works then let vs take that courſe which will make vs able to doe ſo: and that is, to get holy and ſound loue, and to teſtifie our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heart, by our louing behauiour; not to loue in word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone but in deed.
<note place="margin">Iob. 3.18.19. Chap. 5.17.</note>

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>6</label> Out of all which this generall point may bee noted that the ſpeciall time and place of the puniſhment of wicked men is after this life in hell fire, heere vngodly men haue libertie both of hand and foote,

            <p>Therefore let vs neuer enuy their proſperitie,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> nor thinke that God taketh no notice of their ſinnes, becauſe he delaieth to inflict puniſhment vpon them for the ſame. Iudges doe cauſe notorious malefactors to be repriued ſometimes, but it is in no great fauour vnto them, though in the meane time it may be they ſharply correct their owne children: ſo doth the Lord deale, ſeuerely chaſtiſing thoſe that are of his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, but letting reprobates thrine in their ſinfull waies, that in the end he may pay them home for all.</p>
            <p>Secondly,

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14997:93"/>but when wee come to heauen wee ſhall be quite freed from them: and therefore in the meane time let vs not take ſuch offence at them as Browniſts doe, but wait Gods time when he ſhall command his holy Angels to ſeparate them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and to giue them their due in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,

            <p>This doctrine the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> confirmeth vnto vs in ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places,
<note place="margin">Religion is the way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law will he meditate day and night.</hi> And to the ſame effect is that in the other <hi>Pſalme</hi> before named: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements &amp;c.</hi> Throughout which <hi>Pſalme,</hi> we may obſerue as the true and certaine notes of a righteous man, ſo alſo his priuiledges, which are very many, and very great, both in regard of himſelfe, and of his poſterity, which ſhall ſpeede the better for his ſake.

               <note place="margin">Deur. 33.29.</note> where the Lord ſpeaketh vnto his Church in this manner: <hi>Bleſſed art thou O Iſrael, who is like vnto thee, O people ſaued by the Lord, the ſhield of thy helpe, &amp; the ſword of thy glory?</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:14997:94"/>which ſpeech is not to be vnderſtood, as pertaining onely to that nation, but as belonging to all that are the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and that ſerue him with an vpright and faithfull heart. Now what ſaith he of them? <hi>Who is like vnto thee, O Iſral?</hi> Why, if they ſhould haue looked to outward things, they might haue anſwered, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Edomites, Aſſyrians,</hi> yea the very <hi>Canaanites</hi> themſelues are like vnto vs, yea farre beyond vs: for at that time when this was ſpoken, they were in the wilderneſſe, trauelling towards the promiſed land: and what great matters had they then? <hi>Moſes</hi> who was the beſt of them, had not a houſe to reſt his head in, none of them could ſay: this is my ground, there is my corne, thus large are my reuenewes by the yeare &amp;c. but they were all tenants at will, at a daies, or at an howres warning or leſſe, euen as Gods pleaſure was: yet the Lord maketh a chalenge againſt all the world: <hi>Who is like vnto thee O people ſaued by the Lord?</hi> meaning indeed that no nation vnder heauen was compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto them in regard of the wonderfull things that God had wrought for them, and in regard of thoſe heauenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues which he had vouchſafed vnto them: the meaneſt hewer of wood, or drawer of water, amongſt them, was to be preferred before the mightieſt Monarch in the world: and that may be ſaid of all true Chriſtians, which was ſpoken of them: <hi>Who is like vnto thee O people ſaued by the Lord?</hi>

If they come not to the Word, and Sacrament, they are contemners of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: if they doe come, they are profaners of the ſame, and ſo ſhalbe further hardened to their finall perdition: and is not this a wretched caſe? Though for their apparell, they were cloathed as <hi>Salomon</hi> in the midſt of his royalty: though their robes were as rich as was <hi>Aarons</hi> Ephod, or breſt-plate, or the moſt coſtlieſt parts of his garments, all were of no worth without grace: though they fed on the daintieſt diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and did eate Angels foode (as the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> are ſaid to doe) yet if they be ſinfull and rebellious, they ſhall periſh as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> &amp; many other of them did. Though their habitations were as ſumptuous and delightfull as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice</hi> was, yet they could haue no more comfort therein, than <hi>Adam</hi> had, who when he had once broken the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of GOD, in eating of the forbidden fruit: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding al things remained in their excellencie as before, yet he was ſurpriſed with the terrors and feares of a guilty conſcience, and could take no pleaſure in the goodly riuers, in the pleaſant fruits, in the variety of all the creatures that were in the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> &amp;c. but he was faine to flie from Gods preſence, and to hide himſelfe among the tres of the garden. And laſt of all, though their dignity were neuer ſo great: their poſſeſſions neuer ſo ample and large, and their ſubſtance neuer ſo plentifull and aboundant yet they could haue no more comfort in any, or all of theſe things, than <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzer</hi> that impious king had: who for all his valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſouldiers, for all his great cheare and plenty of wine: for all his iollity and triumphing ouer Gods people: for all his merry companions that he had about him, and all

            <p n="1">1 Firſt,
<note place="margin">The price of Grace.</note> concerning the price that was laid downe for the purchaſing of it, it was the greateſt that euer was giuen for any thing; for there goeth more to the buying of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, then to the making of the world: for in the creation, God did but ſay they word, and all things were preſently formed according to their ſeuerall kindes: but in the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, God was not onely to ſay, but to pay alſo, and that full dearely, euen the bloud of his owne ſonne, which was of an infinite valew. And therefore if things are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed according to that which wiſe men wil giue for them, ſuerly the eſtate of Chriſtianity muſt needs be worthy high eſtimation, ſith the wiſe God prouided it for his children at ſuch an ineſtimable reckoning.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Further in reſpect of the rareneſſe thereof,
<note place="margin">The rarenes of it.</note> it is to be accounted very admirable. If things that are very deare were alſo very common, that would diminiſh ſome part of their

<note place="margin">Mat. 7.13.14. Luke. 11.32.</note> but as for this, it is both precious &amp; rare. There are but a very few ſelected ones, that the Lord hath ſingled out, to be partakers of the life of Grace, and to be afterwards heires of the kingdome of glory, which maketh it to be a gift of farre greater eſtimation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Laſtly,

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> that Religion and true piety, is the ready way to the higheſt aduancement: then hence let vs learne to ſet our hearts chiefly thereupon, and aboue all the treaſures in the world, principally to affect that.

But there is not the meaneſt ſeruant, ſlaue, or bondman, but may attaine to this ſpirituall dignity, which is farre beyond all the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the kingdomes of this world can poſſibly yeeld.

<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.21.</note> that thoſe that runne in a race for a prize, though it be but a garland that is ſet vp, ſo that they can gaine onely ſome ſmall credit of their agility and nimbleneſſe in out running one another, yet they will put off all that might clogge and hinder them in their race; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they ſhould runne for a crowne of gold: neither will they be ſo fooliſh as to ſtoop downe to take vp euery pin or point that lyeth in the way; and yet they runne but at an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty: when they haue done their beſt, another may carry away both the honour and commodity from them: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that but one alone can win the prize: and euen hee alſo, though he haue the applauſe at one time, may goe away with the diſgrace at another, or if his credit doe continue all his life time, yet death will take it away at laſt. From all which the Apoſtle would haue vs draw this concluſion, that if ſuch kinde of perſons, notwithſtanding all that hath bene ſayd, will ſo beſtirre themſelues, and ſeeke to acquit themſelues eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way like men: then how much more ought we to put our ſelues to it, and with all alacrity runne the race that is ſet before vs, ſith we runne not at an vncertainty, but are ſure to obtaine the crowne; one ſhall not preuent nor depriue another, but all ſhall vndoubtedly get that which they do expect: and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing that withal we ſtriue for an incorruptible crowne, and ſhall attaine vnto, not a fading and vaniſhing, but an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and euerlaſting dignity.</p>

As we may plainly ſee in the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Phariſes, they would be euery where praying with great deuotion: and very often faſting, with great auſterity, &amp; blowing a trumpet to giue notice vnto men of their almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds and liberality, and ſtriuing with al their might by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obſeruations, to winne themſelues the praiſe of holy and zealous men: yet for all this, our Sauiour ſharply rebuketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying;

By one ſuch meanes or other, God will lay them open to the view of the world: ſo that being in ſuch perill, they cannot but haue a fearefull heart, and a reſtleſſe conſcience. And to this purpoſe, notable is that ſaying of <hi>Salomon: He that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly or ſurely, but he that peruerteth his waies ſhall be known.</hi> Whence it is apparant, that the vpright man needeth not to feare any thing, he needeth not to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ill men: for though they may diſgrace him, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhame him: he needeth not to bee afraide of good men: for the oftner he ſpeaketh to them, and conuerſeth with them, the more he is approued by them: neither needeth he to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of God, for hee that <hi>ſearcheth the heart and the reines,</hi> knoweth and alloweth of the integrity of their ſoules. They haue no cauſe of feare for the preſent, becauſe all things goe well with them: neither is there any for afterwards, becauſe all things ſhall goe well with them, for they ſhall neuer fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God: None can plucke them out of his hand,

It is very dangerous then we ſee to deale hypocritically with God; it is not ſafe with men, to pretend and ſay one thing before their faces, and to ſpeake and do another behind their backes, becauſe they may peraduenture diſcerne it: but it is more dangerous to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God, for he doth certainly diſcerne it, and will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely puniſh it.</p>
            <p>Many when they are reproued, or admoniſhed, will ſnuffe at it, and ſay: What need you bee ſo hot in the matter? I hope you cannot charge me to bee either Whore or Theefe. But though man cannot charge you, (which all cannot ſay) is that a ſufficient diſcharge for you? Nay you muſt looke vnto it, that God find not matter ſufficient to conuict you, either of thoſe particulars, or of worſe and viler offences.</p>
            <p>And let none reply that it is ſufficient, that we frequent Sermons, and partake of the Sacrament, and come to prayer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14997:101"/>in publike, and vſe prayer in the family, and performe other duties that Chriſtian men and women ſhould do, and no more is required at our hands.</p>
            <p>Yes, God doth require more then this:

            <p>And ſo in prayer, though there be neuer ſo many excellent words, apt tearmes, and goodly ſentences, yet if they come from the head and not from the heart, from wit and memory, and not from the inward feeling of the ſoule, they cannot be accepted.
<note place="margin">Ier. 29.</note> God profeſſeth indeed that he will be <hi>found of thoſe that ſeek him:</hi> but then they muſt <hi>ſeek him with their whole heart:</hi> that is, truly and feruently: they muſt not come with a part of their heart, for then they bring no part in Gods account: but with all their heart: for he that giueth him not all, giueth nothing at all. So for the workes of our calling, if we do not labour therein as Gods ſeruants, we can expect no wages, we may haue commendation from men, but we ſhal haue a check and rebuke from the Lord; mens tongues may magnifie vs, but Gods hand will confound vs.</p>
            <p>Therefore let vs, when wee enter vpon any good way, endeuour with an vpright and true heart to go forward in the ſame, otherwiſe it had bene better neuer to haue entred thereinto.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fleſhly followers of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene miraculouſly relieued at his hand with corporall food, once, expect as much againe: and not finding him in one place, where it was likely he would haue bene, they ſeeke him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, where without a miracle he could not be: for the Sea was betweene them, and ſhip they knew there was none left to tranſport him; whereby they tooke occaſion to demand of him when he came thither, inſinuating that they coniectured how he came thither, euen by walking vpon the waters. To theſe our Sauiour directeth the words of this text, and others that follow: not anſwering to their queſtion how he came, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſauoured of adulation, and was ſomewhat friuolous: but diſcouering their purpoſe, why they came, and that was hypocriticall and carnall. Now for the ſence of the words, where he layeth to their charge, that <hi>they ſought him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw the miracle:</hi> it is to be vnderſtood that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not his diuine nature, nor ſought to know him as God and their redeemer, by vertue of the miracle: but onely hoped that he would worke another to feede their bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and make them to fare well often. And hauing repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, he proceedeth to inſtruct them, preſcribing a more wiſe and profitable courſe for themſelues and their ſoules: and that is, to preferre things that are euerlaſting, before thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14997:108"/>that are periſhable &amp; mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tany. Not that he preciſely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to labour for foode, and other maintenance, but to labour couetouſly with too greedy a deſire, to labour immoderately, &amp; with too great trauell: to labour principally for that which is earthly, and more remiſly for that which is heauenly: this is that which he here forbiddeth. By meate, figuratiuely ſo called, <hi>which endureth vnto euerlaſting life,</hi> he meaneth the gifts and graces of Gods holy ſpirit, whereby the ſoules of his people receiue ſtrength &amp; comfort conſtantly: euen vntill the fruition of that bliſſe and immortality, whereunto they ſhall attaine for euermore hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now for their better aſſurance, that they might certainly know that they ſhould not loſe their labour in ſeeking for this durable foode, this bread of life, himſelfe vndertaketh to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it vpon them: and that by the appointment of God his father, who hath ſealed him to this office, as Princes, and great men do authentically confirme the authority of thoſe whom they imploy in weighty affaires, by their ſeales and letters Pattents.</p>

As the Lord liueth, in whoſe ſight I ſtand, if it were not that I regard the preſence of Iehoſhaphat King of Iudah, I would not haue looked towards thee, nor ſeene thee.</hi> Marke how lightly he ſetteth by this wicked king: telling him that he would not giue him ſo much as a good looke, much leſſe be an inſtrument of relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him &amp; his army, were it not for good <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> ſake, whoſe heart was vpright with God, though he were faulty in ioyning with thoſe Idolaters.

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> becauſe otherwiſe we ſhould deale vnfaithfully with ſuch as deale kindly with vs: and when they ſhew their loue vnto vs, we ſhould ſhew our hatred towards them, if we do not helpe them when we haue a calling, and ſome likely hood of doing them good. It were as great an iniury, as if when a patient ſpeaketh friendly to his Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; telleth him that he wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="2">2 In reſpect of our ſelues, if wee be ſlacke in admoniſhing our friends of things amiſſe in them, becauſe they ſpeake lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly, and carry themſelues in a friendly maner towards vs, wee ſhall thereby prouoke Gods diſpleaſure againſt vs: and ſo their faire words &amp; cheareful looks, ſhal looke angerly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, and ſpeake ſharply vnto vs: and we by our ſilence, or by our flatery, ſhall make their ſinnes to become our owne, and ſo both we and they ſhal be puniſhed together.</p>
            <p>This maketh for the iuſt reproofe of thoſe that frame all their praiſes and diſpraiſes according as they themſelues are dealt withall: if they be well ſpoken of and well vſed, they wil be altogether for the parties that do ſo befriend them, and they ſhal be ſure of their good word: but if others be preferred and they neglected, eſpecially if vpon their iuſt deſert, they be roundly taxed and reproued, then the caſe is altered, and the ſtreame of their commendation turned another way, and in ſtead of their former ſpeeches of approbation, you ſhall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14997:110"/>heare from the bitter inuectiues, and termes of reproch, much vnbeſeeming the mouth of a ciuill man, much more of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Of this ſort were thoſe falſe and deceitfull Prophets, which were likened to dogges:
<note place="margin">Michah. 3.5.</note> let men caſt a bone vnto them, as it were, and fill their mouthes with ſomewhat now and then, and they will fawne vpon them, and tell them their caſe is good, they ſhall be ſure of peace and proſperity: God is well pleaſed, and all things ſhall go well with them, albeit in the meane while, they be the moſt vile and wretched men in the world. But as for thoſe that wil not feed their couetous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, though they were the beſt men that liued vpon the earth, they ſhall taſt of their doggiſh behauiour: they ſhall be ſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at, if not bitten: if they put not into their mouthes (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>they prepare warre againſt them:</hi> they furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with a number of bitter and biting reproofes, with a multitude of heauy and grieuous threatnings to powre out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in full meaſure. But theſe are farre from our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſpirit, who would frame his ſpeeches to the good of all without exception: not ſparing thoſe that were kinde vnto him, nor laying loade on men for witholding kindneſſe from him: ſpeaking not pleaſing but profitable things vnto all ſorts. Thus true and feruent loue vnto God and men, made him to deale: and ſelfe loue and ſelfe reſpect maketh falſe hearted hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites to take a quite contrary courſe.</p>
            <p>Here is matter of inſtruction for vs to imitate our Sauiour in this point,

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as he publiſheth their thoughts to others, ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth them for the ſame himſelfe:
<note place="margin">Reproueth them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.4.</note> as the Euangeliſt teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>When Ieſus ſaw their thoughts, he ſaid: wherefore thinke ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill thoughts in your hearts?</hi> Where it is plaine, that therefore he rebuked them, becauſe he diſcerned the corruptneſſe of their thoughts, in iudging hardly of him, becauſe he had ſaid to the man ſicke of the palſie: <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> And indeede what equity were it that Chriſt ſhould blame men for their cogitations, vnleſſe he were the ſearcher of the heart? It is indiſcretion, and an iniurious part for a man to find fault, vnleſſe he can directly proue that which he layeth to another mans charge: and how much vnbeſeeming the infinite wiſedome and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt muſt we needs thinke it then to deale with any in that ſort? Nay he forbiddeth vs to iudge raſhly, and commandeth vs to iudge righteous iudgement: and therefore he will much more obſerue that rule himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he doth correct and puniſh men for their peruerſe and naughty imaginations and affections,
<note place="margin">He paniſheth them.</note> and therefore he muſt needes be a diſcerner of the ſame: for otherwiſe how ſhould he proceed according to euery mans deſert? And that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14997:111"/>he doth inflict puniſhment on men for thoughts,
<note place="margin">Iſay. 29.15.</note> the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſheweth when God chargeth the people, that <hi>though their bodies were neare him, yet their hearts were remoued farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him:</hi> and therefore he threatneth that <hi>he will do a maruellous worke with them,</hi> to wit, that <hi>the wiſedome of the wiſe ſhould periſh,

Now this he would not do, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he could proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guilty: but indeed he is able to indight them, &amp; to produce witneſſes againſt them, that theſe &amp; theſe haue bene their ſecret ſins, ſuch and ſuch vile thoughts they had at ſuch a Sermon, at ſuch a Sacrament, and their hearts were wandring about their pleaſures and profits: they were ful of malicious and reuengfull imaginations and intents, nothing regarding Gods preſence, nothing affecting nor reuerencing his ordinances: and theſe things he can make their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to teſtify againſt them, &amp; therefore doth iuſtly plague the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſame.

Theſe men thinke that grace will grow as weedes doe, without any plowing, manuring or ſowing of the ground: though they neuer pray earneſtly, nor heare careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor be at any paines, for the reforming of their hearts, or of their liues, yet they thinke they ſhall haue goodnes enough by an ordinary courſe, and conclude that heauen ſhall be caſt vpon them, whether they will or not, as if God could not chuſe but ſaue their ſoules.

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as it belongs to him, ſo he alone is of ability to doe it: none beſides him can deale with the heart, wherein this worke doth principally conſiſt. He onely knowes it, and he alone can cure it: as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did kill vs,

            <p>
               <hi>But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weake things of the world to confound the mighty, &amp;c.</hi> that the whole worke, and the glory thereof, may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him alone.</p>

            <p>Neither let vs reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the act done in hearing of the Word,

            <p>Further let vs be admoniſhed hence not to depend vpon the excellency of the Miniſter: for it is God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not man that giueth working to his ordinances.

               <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> alſo was a rare Miniſter, yet he could onely bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with water: Chriſt muſt baptize with holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doth the vertue of the ordinances depend on God? then let vs not be diſcouraged in regard of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Miniſter, or of the outward meanes: for though neither the party adminiſtring, nor the things adminiſtred can breake our hearts, and worke grace therein, yet the Lord can and will do it: therefore let vs not thinke the worſe of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Iewell, becauſe it is brought by a ſimple meſſenger, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14997:118"/>and in a plaine boxe, as it were: neither let vs lightly eſteeme of pure gold, becauſe it is carryed in a leatherne bagge, but let vs value the gift according to the worth of it, and according to the diguity of the giuer.</p>
            <p>If men ſhould iudge according to corrupt reaſon, they would neuer thinke that a poore man by ſpeaking vnto them, by powring a little water vpon them, and by giuing them a little quantity of bread and wine, ſhould make them Kings and fellow-heires with Chriſt Ieſus for euer: but if in this gift we looke vnto the <hi>Sonne of man whom God the Father hath ſealed</hi> and ordayned for that purpoſe, and caſt the eye of our faith vpon the promiſes that are made through him, and the all ſufficient power that is in him, we ſhall eaſily conceiue that all this may be wel effected: for he is a rich fountaine, <hi>Of whoſe fulneſſe we all receiue.</hi> What though our capacity be ſlender? Gods word giueth wiſedome to the ſimple.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7. Ezek. 36.26.</note> What though our hearts be hard? GOD is able and ready to ſoften them. What though we haue plaid the hypocrites? So had theſe here vnto whom our Sauiour directeth this exhortation. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſeeke for the bread of life, when their coming was onely to haue their bellies filled: yet Chriſt doth not caſt them off, but biddeth them <hi>labour for the food that endureth to eternall life:</hi> and then promiſeth to giue them eternall life. And ſo will he deale with vs, albeit we haue bene diſſemblers: yet if now we turne from our hollowneſſe to ſoundneſſe, and from our hypocriſie to plaineneſſe, we ſhall be ſure of a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>This is further for the great conſolation of all Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants.

<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Acts 4 28.</note> being preordained by his owne wiſedome and counſell.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he as mediator muſt of neceſſity vnderſtand of all things before: becauſe he compounded with his Father for our redemption, not raſhly without foreknowledge of that which he ſhould performe, but aduiſedly, agreeing how much he ſhould endure, &amp; what he ſhould pay: euen ſo much as ſhould ſatisfie his Fathers iuſtice, and appeaſe his wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Scripture foretold what he was to vndergo: that one that was neare him ſhould betray him, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in the perſon of <hi>Achitophel;</hi> that he ſhould ſuffer a very grieuous kind of death, ſuch as was long before deſcribed with the particular circumſtances that accompanied it, both in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 22. and <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. beſides ſundry other places. Now he was perfectly acquainted with all the Scriptures, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, they being written by his owne Spirit, and therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that none of his ſufferings therein prefigured and foretold, could be hidden from him: and as he foreſaw what ſhould befal his naturall body, ſo hath he a continuall foreſight of that which ſhall befall his myſtical body, that is, his people, and euery one of them.</p>
            <p>The doctrine thus proued,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> ſerueth firſt for conſolation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all tribulations that may light vpon vs, and all perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that may be raiſed againſt vs, either by bloudy Papiſts or other enemies of the Goſpel. When we ſee them exceeding malitious in their plots, &amp; threatnings, &amp; practiſes, intending &amp; endeuoring to ouerthrow al the ſeruants &amp; ſeruices of God, and to raze them by the very foundations, and not to ſuffer

Therefore is it that our aduerſaries attempt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things againſt vs, which neuer come to paſſe (as it fared with <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the times of old,) becauſe God foreſeeth them,
<note place="margin">Ier. 11.18.</note> and diſappointeth them.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe ſome things do come to paſſe according to their hearts deſire, the Lord knew of them before, and therefore did not preuent them, becauſe he ſaw they could not be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs. He is as a wiſe Father, that wil haue his children to ſeele ſomewhat that may be for their ſmart and paine, as knowing it will turne to their good at length: but he will ſtay any thing that might procure their vndoing and ouerthrow: and therefore Chriſt pronounceth them happy and bleſſed that ſuffer for his name ſake, either diſgraces, or loſſe of goods,
<note place="margin">Mat 5.</note> or baniſhment, or impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or death it ſelfe. As farre then as any of theſe may hinder our happineſſe, we ſhal be ſure to be freed from them,

            </p>
            <p>They who are moſt iealous of their owne corruptions, are beſt fortified againſt dangerous falles. Therefore is it ſaid by the wiſe man:
<note place="margin">Prou. 28.14.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is he that feareth alwaies, but he that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchiefe.</hi> That was <hi>Haſaels</hi> caſe: he ſuſpected not himſelfe, and therefore when the Prophet told him that he ſhould be a cruell man, that he ſhould ſlay the yong men of Iſrael with the ſword, and daſh their infants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtones, and rend in peeces their women with child: he ſaid vnto the Prophet, What? <hi>Is thy ſeruant a dogge that I ſhould do this great thing?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 8.12.23</note> As if he had ſaid, I were worſe then a dogge if I ſhould euer ſhew ſuch immanity and fierceneſſe, and ſuch beaſtly violence: but the Prophets words fell out to be true: he would not miſtruſt his owne heart, and therefore he became ſauage as a Wolfe, &amp; fierce as a Lyon. The example of <hi>Dauid</hi> will adde further light vnto this point: for as long as he was awed by Gods correcting hand, and fearing himſelfe, kept a narrow watch ouer all his waies, he ſtood firme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable againſt all aſſaults: but when he grew feareleſſe and careleſſe, we know what a grieuous and dangerous fall he had. So <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles as long as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of themſelues (as concerning this matter of treaſon they were) none of them fell: but when he &amp; the reſt grew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their owne ſtrength, then they all plaid the cowards, eſpecially <hi>Peter</hi> that was moſt reſolute in an opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For whereas he profeſſed that whatſoeuer his Maiſter thought of him, he would neuer forſake him: Chriſt muſt be content for once to be miſtaken and deceiued in him: he was another maner of man then he conceiued him to be: whereas (I ſay) he was thus preſumptuous of his owne courage in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out, he that boaſted he would ſtand it out euen vnto death, was daunted with a word: and whereas he thought if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14997:122"/>the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warre had come againſt him with ſwords, he ſhould haue defied them all, and ſtucke vnto his maiſter, a poore ſilly wench with the onely breath of her lips, maketh him lye and ſweare, and forſweare his Sauiour. So that from thoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it is euident, that when men are doubtfull and diſtruſtfull of themſelues, then they ſpeed well: but when they are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of themſelues, then they ſlip and ſlide, and fall excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangerouſly. And this may be yet further confirmed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by reaſons:

<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.2.</note> yet they grow ſtrong in him, and in the power of his might.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as they haue God to keepe them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo will they with all diligence keepe their owne hearts, and auoide all occaſions and allurements vnto euill. As one that is afraid of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, will be very carefull to auoide the infection, and for that end carry wormewood, &amp;c. in his hand, and take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what next his ſtomacke, that may fence him againſt it; if he be to walke abroad, taking heed what company he comes into, and how hee paſſeth through any ſtreet, or by any dore where the ſickneſſe is hotte: whereas on the contrary, he that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not to be infectious, cares not what company he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeth with, nor what places he cometh vnto, but if he expect a booty, wil goe to their beds ſides that are ſicke of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue plaguy ſtuffe, or plaguy garments, or the like. So it is for ſinne he that ſeeth the pit and infection of it, will eſchew all company, enticements, &amp; occaſions, that may draw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: but as for thoſe who ſee not or feare not the proneneſſe of their nature to fall into iniquity, nor the dangerouſnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when they are plunged in it; they are altogether negligent in looking to their hearts, and to their behauiour, entertaining impure luſts in their ſoules, not caring whither they caſt their eies, nor what ſinful obiects they meet withal for the poiſoning
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14997:123"/>and corrupting of their affections. Whence it often times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that they are very ſhamefully ouertaken: for when they waxe ſo bold and venturous, it is iuſt with God to giue them ouer vnto themſelues,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6.7 2. Sam. 11.1.2.</note> yea though they be his owne children. As he dealt with <hi>Dauid</hi> when his heart was lifted vp, and he preſumed that his mountaine was ſo ſtrong that he ſhould neuer be moued, when he gaue him ſelfe to his eaſe, &amp; tooke liberty for his eye, as if there had not bene in him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to adultery, we reade what great ſinnes &amp; miſeries he fell into: how much more then will the Lords hand be vpon the vngodly ones of the world, that do altogether harden their hearts from his feare, neuer eſchewing the baits of ſinne, nor the ſnares wherein Sathan ſeeketh to take them, and to hold them faſt vnto their eternall condemnation?

Chron. 24.20 21.22.</note> he forgot <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> and cruelly murdered his ſon, <hi>Zecariah</hi> an holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, for doing the meſſage of the Lord vnto him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing him and his princes for their idolatry.</p>
            <p>To this point our Sauiour giueth further teſtimony, telling his Diſciples what ſhould fall out vpon the preaching of the

<note place="margin">Mat. 10 21.</note> 
               <hi>The brother ſhall betray the brother to death, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſonne, and the children ſhall riſe againſt their parents, and ſhall cauſe them to dye.</hi> What nearer bonds then theſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of children to their parents, who haue bene the meanes of their life, of their education, and in a word, of all the good things that they either do or ſhall enioy, and that not without great paines and charges, and troubles vnto themſelues? yet for all this, if children be impious, and their parents religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they will not ſticke to betray them, and to put them to death. So that by theſe proofes it is cleare and euident, that no bands of kindneſſe or of nature will hold, where the bands of religion are wanting. And there is reaſon for it: for</p>

               </label> the Diuel hath the diſpoſing of al vngodly mens hearts, and therefore vntill ſuch time as he grow kinde vnto Gods children,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nothing in the world, (but Gods ouerruling hand) can make his lims true and truſty friends vnto the members of Chriſt: for Sathan hauing the command of them, will enforce them (will they, nill they) to be vnkind, vnthankfull, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous vnto Gods ſeruants that haue bene moſt benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is in all vnregenerate men abundance of pride, which maketh them to thinke that whatſoeuer is done for them either by GOD or men, it is due debt, and nothing more then their deſerts do require: and therefore when they are ſat and full, they ſpurne with the heele againſt the giuers. And this let vs ſet downe for a certaine ground, that they which ſhew themſelues vnfaithfull and diſloyal vnto GOD, notwithſtanding all his benefites, will neuer be true and firme friends vnto vs, how nearly &amp; ſtrongly ſoeuer they are linked vnto vs in outward reſpects: he that is not Gods friend, can neuer be our faithfull friend.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wicked men do loue ſinne better then any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite: and therefore will they fall out with their kindeſt friends rather then with their beloued corruptions, and be diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto any, yea aduenture the damning of their own ſoules eternally, rather then croſſe their wretched luſts, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt their ſinfull affections.</p>
            <p>For inſtruction,

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14997:124"/>all ſinners are ſo vnfaithfull, therefore we ſhould beware how we truſt them, and how we commit our ſelues or our ſecrets vnto them: for albeit their lookes be faire and ſmooth, and their ſpeeches and outward cariage ſeeme louing and kind: yet if they feare not God, they will lye in waite for an aduantage, and do vs a miſchiefe before we be aware, if we take not the better heede of them: and therefore let vs not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelues vnto them.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Sauiour did lay open himſelfe vnto <hi>Iudas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew that <hi>Iudas</hi> was appointed for that work, and the will of his Father muſt needs be fulfilled: but we not hauing the like reaſon, muſt not imitate our Sauiour herein, nor acquaint ſuch perſons with our counſels: much leſſe let vs prouoke them, and caſt our ſelues into their danger: for if they haue vs once in the ſnare, there is no hope of mercy, except the Lord worke for vs extraordinarily.</p>
            <p>Let men therefore looke heedfully vnto themſelues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware as of others, ſo of vntruſty ſeruants, of vngodly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea of vnholy yoke-fellowes: for there is no fidelity to be expected, where the true feare of God is not planted in the heart. They are bound to pray for them, to inſtruct them, and ſhew them any kindneſſe that ciuility or Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bindeth them to performe: but herein their wiſdome muſt appeare, that they bee not too open-hearted vnto them, nor too ready to put them in truſt in matters of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> here is matter of comfort to all ſuch as are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their dealings, that would rather lay downe their liues, then deale diſhoneſtly, or diſcourteouſly: this is a great grace of God, to require friendſhip to their friends, &amp; to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thankfull for benefites receiued. And indeed true and ſound thankfulneſſe can be in none, but onely in thoſe that are truly gracious: wicked men may be glad of a good turne, and in outward complement of words and behauiour make a ſemblance and ſhew of thankfulneſſe: but to be truly ioyfull, as ſeeing GODS hand in a kindneſſe receiued, and heartily and in conſcience to loue the party whom God hath made an inſtrument of that good, with a deſire and indeauour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite

            <p>God had ſaid, that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould be a traitour: he is a traitour: God had determined (&amp; Chriſt had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed it) that he ſhould be a diuel he is ſuch an one, yet al to his wo.

Do I practiſe good duties becauſe God calleth for them? then ſhall my ſeruice be acceptable vnto God: do I forbeare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill becauſe he forbideth it? then do I that which is pleaſing vnto him, otherwiſe not.

            <q>It had bene good for that man, if he had neuer bene borne.</q>
            <p>It is good for vs that he was borne, becauſe we haue benefite thereby: but not for him, becauſe whatſoeuer matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment he had in his life time, turned at length to the increaſe of his miſery, and to his perpetuall damnation. Whence this

            <p>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> had life it ſelfe, which is a thing very delightfull, and of which it is truly ſaid, though by a lying ſpirit: <hi>Skin for ſkin, and all that euer a man hath,

            <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Saul, Ieroboam, Ahab,</hi> and many other kings.

<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">The vertue of the Sacrament is from Gods owne hand. See the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on <hi>Iohn</hi> the 6.</note> is from Gods owne hand, through the mediation of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>God giues it, and Chriſt procures the benefite of it vnto his people: and this is common to all other ordinances and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Sacrament.

            <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> one generall reaſon of this doctrine is, that <hi>euery good giuing, and euery perfect gift is from aboue, and cometh downe from the Father of lights.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 1.17.</note> Now what more excellent &amp; perfect gift can there be then the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt? and therefore if God be the author and giuer of all other good
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14997:127"/>things, this muſt of neceſſity proceed from his bounty in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner.</p>
            <p>A ſecond cauſe why God wil haue the diſpoſing of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his owne hand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is, that there might be a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and all his Miniſters, and that he might retaine that prerogatiue for Chriſt Ieſus alone: for he it is that <hi>giueth the meate which endureth to euerlaſting life.</hi> And the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Father hath ſealed him,</hi> that is, the Lord hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized him by the broade ſeale of heauen, and will et none to be copartners with him in that office: he is the Lord Treaſurer of all graces, and therefore he muſt bleſſe his ordinances vnto vs, if euer we looke for benefite thereby. In which regard <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaith: <hi>I baptize you with water,</hi> &amp; that is all that he could do; as for waſhing of the heart, and purging of the conſcience, that he attributeth wholly vnto Chriſt Ieſus:
<note place="margin">Matth. 3.11.</note> 
               <hi>He will baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire. Iohn</hi> would not arrogate that vnto himſelfe, leſt he ſhould treacherouſly lay claime to that which is proper vnto the crowne. The like faithfulneſſe in giuing God his due, we ſee in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, I <hi>haue planted, Apollos watered,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.6.</note> but God giueth the increaſe:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intimating, that the beſt Miniſters are but as Gardeners in the Lords Church: they can but put the ſcions into the ſtock, or the roote into the ground. And as poſſible it is for a man to make a tree, as for a Miniſter to make a Chriſtian: and as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to put ſap into a dead blocke, and to make it grow and flouriſh, and bring forth fruit in aboundance, as for a Miniſter to put into any the leaſt drop of grace, or to adde any whit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, where it is already wrought.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Lord wil haue the vertue of the Sacrament to be in his owne power, to beſtow where &amp; how he will, that there might be a difference betweene Communicants, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the good and the bad. If it were in mens hands to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and did conſiſt in the deede done, as ignorant Papiſts imagine, men would beſtow it promiſcuouſly, and wicked hypocrites ſhould haue as good a ſhare as thoſe that are truly religious, and the worſt ſpeed as well as the beſt: for men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſearch the hearts of their people, to ſee with what prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they come: and there is that loue in them (which is a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14997:128"/>thing commendable) that they deſire all might be faued. If <hi>Moſes</hi> could haue giuen euery man in Iſrael grace when he gaue them the <hi>Manna,</hi> he would haue done it: he that could haue bene content, that his name ſhould be razed out of the booke of life for their ſakes, would not haue ſtuck with them for ſuch a matter. If <hi>Abraham</hi> could haue circumciſed <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> heart, when he circumciſed his fleſh, he ſhould not haue bene excommunicated for his prophaneneſſe: but God hath alwaies heretofore, and doth ſtill keep this power in his owne hand, that ſo he may enrich with grace thoſe whom he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fitteſt, and deale with euery one as he knoweth their hearts.

                  <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, which is giuen for you, which is broken for you:</hi> and ſo of the wine: <hi>Drinke ye all of it, this is my bloud which is ſhed for you.</hi> Now what can be nearer vnto vs then our meate and drinke? We haue greater intereſt in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then in our foode: for that is made a part of our ſelues. If we eate meate in another mans houſe, after we haue receiued it, it is more ours, then his that prepared it; no one ioint is ſo neare another, nor the ſoule ſo neare to the body, as our foode is neare vs, when once it is digeſted and turned into nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs: which doth plainly repreſent vnto vs the neare coniunction that is betwixt Chriſt &amp; euery worthy receiuer. Hence proceedeth that ſpeech of the Apoſtle: <hi>The cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which we bleſſe,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16,</note> is it not the communion of the bloud of Chriſt? the bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> that is, do not theſe cauſe vs to haue an effectuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now if queſtion ſhould be made, why Chriſt ſhould make choiſe of bread to be a ſigne in this Sacrament, rather then of any other more excellent and glorious creature:</p>
               <p>The anſwer is,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> that he did it for diuerſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Why GOD made choiſe of bread.</note> Becauſe it was his will, as it is ſaid concerning the Goſpel, that <hi>it pleaſed him by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſone them that beleeue.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14997:130"/>
               <p>There is beſides his pleaſure, great wiſedome in it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe it is very fit to repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that vnto vs for which it was ordianed it being ſubſtantiall foode, and therefore called the ſtaffe of mans life, on which it doth as it were leane, and whereby it is vpholden: and beſides, this is for euery mans ſtomach, and for euery ones ſtate, and may euery where be gotten, And yet withall we muſt know that bread cannot fully expreſſe the efficacy of the ſpiritualll food Chriſt Ieſus, which we are to feed vpon: for bread is earthly, that food is heauenly; bread preſerueth the corporall life, and that but for a time; Chriſt not onely preſerueth, but giueth, not a naturall, but a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, not a temporall, but an eternall life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God made choyce of bread,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in reſpect of his owne glory, that the weaker the meanes are, the ſtronger his hand might appeare to be. If we had bene to receiue gold or gemmes, or precious ſtones, our ſenſes would haue bene more wrought on then our hearts, and we ſhould haue more regarded the ſigne then the thing ſignified: the which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, with other of the like kind, the Lord by giuing vs bread, hath preuented.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that the bread (as alſo the wine) in the Lords Supper is of ſuch excellent force and vſe, as to put vs in mind of Chriſts death and bloudſhedding, to teſtifie his vndoubted, true and reall preſence to euery faithfull communicant, and to refreſh and feede the ſoules of the worthy receiuers vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: in which regard they doe as farre ſurmount com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread and wine, as the waxe wherewith a pardon or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any other euidence is ſealed, is of more worth then that which is to be ſold in the trade mans ſhop. Seeing (I ſay) that the bread is of ſuch ſingular vſe, this maketh, firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Papiſts, which hold that after the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration there remaineth no bread at all, but that it is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into the very body of Chriſt. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndeed we graunt that as the bread, ſo Chriſt his body is there offered and receiued by euery faithfull communicant: but how? nor corporally, but ſpiritually: not from the Miniſtres hand, but from God hand; not by ſenſe but by faith. And for the further clearning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of this truth, many reaſons might be brought, but I wil
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14997:131"/>produce but onely ſome few.</p>
               <p>The firſt is taken from the expreſſe words of the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures who mentioneth bread after the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration:
<note place="margin">Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</note> ſaying <hi>(the bread which we breake)</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16. and againe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>He that eateth this bread &amp;c.</hi>) I <hi>Corinthians</hi> 11.27.28.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon is this:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We receiue the ſame in ſubſtance which the Fathers did in the wilderneſſe, I. Cor, 10.1. for the <hi>Manna</hi> is there called ſpirituall meate, and the rocke is ſaid to be Chriſt: now it is certaine that they did not corporally eate the body, and drinke the bloud of Chriſt, becauſe he had not then aſſumed our nature: and our Sauiour denieth the <hi>Manna</hi> to bee the true bread,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.32.</note> which came downe from heauen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if the bread by the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration be tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated, it wil follow that wicked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municants may alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſt (for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> that all, good and bad did eate the <hi>ſame ſpirituall meate &amp;c.</hi> as touching the outward ſigne and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement,) and ſo cannot afterwards periſh, and be damned; for that whoſoeuer <hi>eateth of Chriſt his fleſh &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.55.56.</note> hath eternall life,</hi> and he will raiſe him at the laſt day: for he dwelleth in vs, and we in him. Now it is certain that there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion betwixt the Lord Ieſus &amp; wicked ſinners, neither are they in the ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, neither ſhall they be raiſed vp vnto Glory, at the laſt day: and conſequently, they feede not on him, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſignes are not tranſubſtantiated into him.</p>
               <p>A fourth reaſon is from the end for which the Sacrament was inſtituted by Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and is continued in his Church. Then his meaning was not according to his humane nature, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with his people one earth after a bodily manner: for though he were preſent with his diſciples at the firſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſenſibly in his manhoode, yet the purpoſe of it for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was to continue a memoriall of him, when the heauens ſhould containe him:
<note place="margin">Acts, 3, 21. Luke, 22, 29.</note> therefore (ſaith he) <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Which ſhould be ſuperfluous and needleſſe if he were continually conuerſant with his members euery where in the Maſſe, and in the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly many fowle abſurdities do enſue vpon this groſſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14997:131"/>of tranſubſtantiation, for</p>
               <p>Firſt, either one Chriſt in his bodily preſence muſt be both in heauen and earth,
<note place="margin">Abſurdities,</note> and in innumerable places there at one inſtant: or elſe be multiplyed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and many Chriſts &amp; many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours, and many redeemers, muſt be diſperſed throughout all the Churches, where the Maſſe is offred, or the Sacrament adminiſtred: and ſo when the Lord did firſt celebrate it, there was to be one Chriſt breaking and diſtributing, and another Chriſt broken and giuen: one Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> another Chriſt to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to euery Apoſtle one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how can cruelty be here auoided?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how can men deuoure him, and not kill him? how ſhould men ſwallow him vp, and yet offer no violence vnto him?</p>
               <p>A glorious body may be in many places at once,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> and be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and not hurt, becauſe it is not patible nor mortall.</p>
               <p>But when the Diſciples firſt receiued him,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> he was both mortall (for he dyed on the morrow,) and patible: for he was in an agony and torment that night: and therefore how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe that the nailes ſhould haue force to kill him, which onely pierced ſome part of his body, rather then their teeth which chewed him whole?</p>
               <p>But he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>So it is ſacramentally and by a <hi>Trope:</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> but not literally and ſimply, as the words may be miſconſtrued. The like kinde of ſpeech is vſed in other Sacraments: Circumciſion is called <hi>the couenant, Gen.</hi> 17.13. the Lambe is called the <hi>Paſſeouer, Exod.</hi> 12.11. the rock, Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14. And is not the cup ſayd as well to be the <hi>bloud of the new Teſtament:</hi> and yet our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calleth the conſecrated wine the <hi>fruit of the vine? Matth.</hi> 26.29.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.53.55.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect, </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee haue no life in you: for my fleſh is meate indeede, and my bloud is drinke indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſpeaketh not there of the Sacrament,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> but rather of the faithfull embracing of him in his word: for the Lords Supper was neuer before, nor at that time inſtituted, and as yet the words of conſecration had not bene ſpoken: and therefore if this be vnderſtood literally without the ſpirituall meaning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14997:132"/>thereof, it will follow, that either Tranſubſtantiation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Supper, or the Lords Supper before the night in which he was betrayed. And in this place he maketh no mention of bread to be turned into his body: and the words wreſted, would rather argue his body to be tranſubſtantiated into bread, or fleſh, then breade to be changed into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> as this ſerueth for the confutation of them that hold there is no bread at all in the Lords Supper: ſo it maketh againſt ſuch as thinke there is nothing but bread to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted there: that we are to receiue onely the outward ſigne in a bare remembrance of Chriſt his death and paſſion: and ſo do they depraue the myſteries of God, and extenuate his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: as if when the Lord calleth all his people to this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble banquet, he ſhould deceiue them with empty diſhes, and with painted meat in ſtead of better cheere.
<note place="margin">Eſter. 1:</note> It would haue bene a great diſgrace for <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> to haue dealt ſo, when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all his Princes to a banquet: and therefore they are iuſtly to be reproued, that eſteeme ſo baſely of this holy feaſt, ſeing God offereth, and exhibiteth truly, though not corporally, his owne Sonne, with all his precious merits to euery faithfull receiuer: ſo that euery gueſt at his table may truly be ſaid to feede on Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> this is for inſtruction, that ſeeing by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we may be ſo nearely vnited vnto Chriſt, we ſhould come with a large expectation of receiuing good from the ſame: and therefore make preparation for the ſame according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſo we may not come vnworthily, leſt we receiue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſtead of mercies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here is another inſtruction, that when we come to this celeſtiall feaſt, we fall to it, and feed of it, as Chriſt bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, <hi>Take, and eate,:</hi> let vs ſet our eyes, our eares, our taſte, yea and our hearts alſo aworke, with all ſerious meditation, to make vſe of thoſe heauenly myſteries: and when we ſee the bread broken, let vs boldly conclude, Chriſt was broken for me, and therefore I ſhall eſcape the breaking which I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: and when the bread is giuen vnto vs, let vs reſolue, Chriſt with all his benefites is beſtowed vpon me: and when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14997:132"/>we eate the bread, let vs aſſure our ſoules of this, Chriſt is made vnto me the true bread, whereby my ſoule ſhall be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed vnto life eternall. This is the earing that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and accepteth and thus doing we ſhall ſhew that there is mutuall loue and kindneſſe betwixt him and vs, which is a thing well pleaſing vnto him: and therefore he exhorteth all his ſeruants, ſaying: <hi>Eate, O friends, drinke and make you merry,
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.1</note> O welbeloued.</hi> None but thoſe that are friends can eate of his dainties, and all thoſe that are friends will eate of the ſame: &amp; therefore if euer we would ſhew our ſelues to be Chriſt his friends, if we would enioy the feeling of his loue vnto vs, and be aſſured of our loue towards him, let vs refreſh our ſoules at this banquet, and not let our Sauiour be at coſt in vaine, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo good and ſo large prouiſion for vs.</p>

               <p>We haue here not onely bread, but wine, not onely the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, but his bloud alſo, euen the whole Chriſt with all his graces, offered vnto vs. This is promiſed in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where it is ſaid:

               <p>Secondly, his loue vnto vs his people is ſuch,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; ready to doe it. Some men whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make feaſts,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> could prouide variety of good cheare, but they are loath to go to the charges: others are franke and liberall enough, but they want ability to giue great intertainment, ſo that they ſpeake that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which others doe vaine gloriouſly: I am ſorry that your cheare is no better. But it is otherwiſe with the Lord: as he is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14997:133"/>bountifull and will not ſpare coſt, ſo is he rich in all aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly treaſures, and needs not ſpare coſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing Chriſt hath prayed that al his gheſts might haue of the beſt, they ſhal not faile of any thing that their heart can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and long for.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially ſeeing it is for his owne glory. A mortal ſinfull man, euen the king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> for the ſetting forth of his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and greatneſſe, ſpared no coſt in the feaſt that he made vnto his Princes:
<note place="margin">Eſter 1,</note> much leſſe wil the Lord of glory in this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet which he prouideth for his people, feeing that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably better able, and more bountifull, and withall ſeeth and conſidereth the ſeuerall needes and neceſſities of all his children.</p>
               <p>Here then in the firſt place,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> is confuted the error of Popiſh Prieſts, that will haue but one kind of food at this table, and ſo cauſe the people to haue a dry feaſt without any wine at al: thus do they ſacrilegiouſly rob Gods people of that allowance which he hath appointed for them, and him of that glory which is due in reſpect of his large bounty in this behalfe. For whereas the Lord inſtituted the cup as well as the bread, and prayed and gaue thanks for the one as wel as for the other, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drinke all of the wine, as well as eate of the bread: they teach and practiſe the cleane contrary And that their ſacriledge may not ſeeme ſo vile as in truth it is,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect, </seg>
                  </label> they produce ſome ſhewes of reaſon for this their dealing: It is needleſſe (ſay they) to adde the wine vnto the bread: for when we receiue that, we feede on the whole Chriſt, and partaking of his body, we muſt needs withall partake of his blood, which is contained in the veines.</p>
               <p>See here how ſhameleſly they controll Chriſt himſelfe:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer, </seg>
                  </label> for if we receiue the bloud in receiuing his body, why did he ordain the cuppe as well as the bread?</p>
               <p>They anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> that Chriſt gaue it onely to Miniſters, and ſo doe they.</p>
               <p>So did he the bread alſo,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> and therefore by the ſame reaſon, they may adminiſter neither bread nor wine vnto the Laity: and what reaſon can they alleadge why Miniſters may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bloud in the veines, as well as any other? But the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14997:133"/>words of Chriſt may decide this controuerſie when he ſaith, <hi>Drinke yee all of this, this is my bloud, &amp;c. which is ſhed for you and for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And who are thoſe many? euen all that ſhould afterwards beleeue in him. To thoſe for whom Chriſt his bloud was ſhed, the cuppe muſt be adminiſtred: but his bloud was ſhed for priuate men as wel as for Miniſters: and therefore the cuppe muſt be adminiſtred to them as well as vnto the Apoſtles themſelues.</p>
               <p>A ſecond vſe of this point is for inſtruction,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that ſeeing there is ſuch plenty and variety of all good things offered vs at this banquet, no other feaſting, or voluptuous liuing ſhould either keepe vs from it, or make vs come vnworthily vnto it: yet how many are there, that do ſo glut themſelues with eating and drinking, and ſurfetting on their carnall delights, that they are altogether vnfit for the Lords table?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is matter of reioycing for Gods poore ſeruants,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> that though they fare hard at home, yet they may haue as good refreſhing as any other in the Lords houſe: for Chriſt Ieſus doth there prouide a full meale for them. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> comfort when he was baniſhed from the aſſemblies of Saints, and could not be preſent at the Sacraments and ſacrifices: when he could but remember that he had bene at them, and alſo bene a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table communicant as oft as he could, it did much refreſh his ſoule, ſo that it was ſatiſfied as <hi>with marrow and fatneſſe,</hi> with the very meditation therof: he had receiued ſuch ſtore of grace from Gods ordinances, and ſuch a ſtrong apprehenſion of his fauor, that he counted it better then life it ſelfe. And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof did not onely comfort his ſoule, but helped him alſo in his bodily neceſſities, in ſo much that when he was in a barren and dry wilderneſſe, pinched with hunger, and preſſed with thirſt, the very remembrance of thoſe things that were paſt long before, did cauſe him more chearefully to vndergoe all his penury and want. If he then tooke ſuch comfort therein in his abſence, how much more ſhould we being preſent at the ſame?</p>

That was, and this is: when that was inſufficient in ſome reſpects, the Lord aboliſhed it and eſtabliſhed this in ſtead thereof, as being much better then that; for though both of them aime at ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt, yet it is in a different manner: for</p>
               <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the old and new Coue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant.</note> That was obſcure, conſiſting in rites and ceremonies, where by Chriſt was darkly perfigured: but this is more plaine and perpicuous, ſo that Gods mercy and goodneſſe towards vs in his Sonne may more clearly and euidently be diſcerned in this one Sacrament, then it could by all their ſacrifices. Then the bloud of beaſtes was ſhed in ſtead of Chriſts, but now hath he ſhed his owne bloud for vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that Teſtament was apropriated to a few; and did belong properly to the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> alone: and if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations would haue their part in it, they muſt vnite themſelues vnto the <hi>Iewes:</hi> but this hath a larger extent, and pertaineth to all Gods elect throughout the whole world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that conueied vnto men a ſmaller meaſure of grace;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this offereth great plenty and ſtore thereof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly that was temporary and to endure but a while;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this is perpetuall, and ſhall laſt to the ende of the world: and thus much for the differences betwixt the old Teſtament and the new. Now in that our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>This is my bloud of the new Teſtament &amp;c.</hi> the Doct. is that,</p>
               <p>Faithfull communicants at the Lord table come not onely to be refreſhed at a feaſt,

               <p>The particular legacies with Chriſt Ieſus hath bequeathed vnto them are ſpecified in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes: This is the Teſtament that I will make vnto them, after thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord,
<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.16.17</note> I will put my lawes in their heart, and in their minds I will write them, And their ſinnes and iniquities wil I remember no more.</hi> The ſubſtance of which couenant is this, that all their ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen, and both the guilt, and puniſhment thereof wholy remoued: yea they ſhall not onely be iuſtified, but alſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14997:134"/>ſanctified, the lawes of God and his promiſes ſhall be written in their minds, ſo that they ſhall haue the knowledge of them: and in their hearts, ſo that they ſhall haue the comfort and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fruition of them: they ſhall not onely haue intereſt in all Gods graces and bleſſings, but according to their neede ſhall haue the vſe and enioyment thereof. And what treaſures are comparable vnto theſe? if we ſhould receiue many ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds at euery Sermon, and Sacrament, it were nothing to this legacy, which is ſealed vnto vs in the Lords Supper: the worth whereof is ſo much the greater, by how much it hath more excellent appurtenances annexed vnto it beyond that which other Wils haue, for</p>
               <p>Firſt, when other legacies are paid,

               <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whereas when men haue bequeathed any thing vnto vs, we muſt ſtay for it, till their breath be out of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: here it is otherwiſe: when once we haue this Teſtament ſealed vnto vs, we ſhall haue preſent participation of the things therein made ſure vnto vs, becauſe the Teſtatour is already deceaſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whereas others leaue executors to performe their Wils, the Lord liueth for euer, ſo that he himſelfe that made it, will alſo execute it: and therefore as it is called a Teſtament, ſo is it alſo elswhere tearmed a couenant: for the fulfilling whereof, the Lord hath entered into bonds,
<note place="margin">Ier. 31.31.</note> and pawned his word and promiſe, his truth and fidelity, his oath, yea him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his nature, and all that he hath: ſo that it is impoſſible he ſhould faile in performing the leſt clauſe therof.

               <p>Secondly, here is a comfort for Gods poore ſeruants:

And as in reſpect of themſelues, ſo alſo of their children, this offereth them matter of conſolation. Alas poore creatures (ſay many) we haue little or nothing to leaue them: but haue you procured them a lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt his will? if you doe ſo, though you haue little, he hath much, and therefore neuer be afraid: they ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prouided for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,

               <p>Knowing that you ſhall receiue in reward from the Lord, life, as an inheritance which he will freely as vpon his children, beſtow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: for it ought to vphold you in your dutifull ſeruice, that you ſerue not ſo much your maiſters, which are but men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſometimes vnthankfull and vnable to recompence; but the Lord, who is both able, and will recompence your well doing.</p>
